In the world of high-end audio, occasionally a product emerges that completely overturns established conventions. The Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC from American manufacturer Abyss Headphones represents exactly such a phenomenon. It refuses to fit within the simple category of "luxury headphones," boldly challenging audiophiles across every aspect of its design philosophy, ergonomics, and sound tuning like a gauntlet thrown down [1](#ref-1).

The evaluations surrounding this headphone demonstrate extreme polarization. While some fervent supporters praise it as "the best-sounding headphone on Earth" [3](#ref-3), harsh criticism exists regarding its unique design, fit, and the manufacturer's approach [5](#ref-5). This divergence in opinion reveals that the AB-1266 Phi TC is not merely an audio device but rather a "phenomenon."

The purpose of this article is to explore the truth that lies between these extreme evaluations. By listening to both the enthusiasm and criticism, we will comprehensively and neutrally dissect and analyze the AB-1266 Phi TC from the perspectives of design philosophy, physical structure, subjective sound experience, and objective measurement data. By peering into this deep and sometimes incomprehensible "abyss," we aim to clarify the essence of this incomparable headphone and for whom it truly exists.

## **1\. From JPS Labs to Abyss: The Heretical Bloodline**

To understand the Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC, we must first examine its origins—the philosophy of its parent company, JPS Labs LLC. Abyss Headphones, while an independent brand, was established as a division of JPS Labs [7](#ref-7).

### **The JPS Labs Legacy: Pursuit of Signal Purity**

Founded in 1990 by Joe Skubinski, JPS Labs has established a solid position in the high-end audio cable field [7](#ref-7). At the core of their design philosophy lies the thorough pursuit of purity in signal transmission, based on fundamental sciences such as metallurgy and materials science [7](#ref-7). Their proprietary aluminum-copper alloy conductor "Alumiloy" is known for achieving bandwidth and transparency previously unattainable with conventional conductors [9](#ref-9). For them, cables are not merely connection means between components but represent a physical challenge of transmitting musical signal energy with minimal loss and contamination.

This philosophy is prominently reflected in their product structure. Perfect shielding against external noise, elimination of resonances, and minimizing signal path length—all serve to thoroughly exclude extraneous elements beyond the musical signal, faithfully conveying only the information recorded at the source [7](#ref-7).

### **From Cables to Headphones: Physical Manifestation of Philosophy**

Skubinski's decision to enter the headphone market was an attempt to extend this philosophy of "uncompromising signal transmission" from cables—passive components—to transducers that actually generate sound [2](#ref-2). After five years of research and development, the original AB-1266 launched in 2013 as a heretic that ignored all existing headphone design rules, instantly shocking the market. Achieving such completion that it was described as a "home run on the first swing," it carved the Abyss name into high-end audio history [2](#ref-2).

The AB-1266 Phi TC examined in this article stands at the pinnacle of the improvement lineage from the original model through Phi and CC [12](#ref-12). "TC" means "Total Consciousness," expressing confidence in the unprecedented resolution provided by the newly designed 66mm planar magnetic driver [14](#ref-14). The fact that the entire manufacturing process—from CNC machining of aluminum frames to driver production and assembly—is consistently performed at their Buffalo, New York facility demonstrates their thorough commitment to quality control [3](#ref-3).

Considering how JPS Labs' cable philosophy manifested in the AB-1266 headphone is extremely important. Just as JPS Labs cables pursued perfect "shielding" to protect signals from external noise, the AB-1266's massive all-metal frame functions as a perfect "shield" for the driver. This serves as an acoustic and mechanical fortress, isolating the driver from internal "noise" such as unnecessary resonances and vibrations generated by the chassis itself, allowing pure musical signals alone to be converted to sound waves [14](#ref-14). Within this context, the extraordinarily excessive weight, industrial-looking rugged design, and sales strategy of including expensive JPS Labs cables in the standard package [15](#ref-15) can be understood as logical consequences of consistent design philosophy. For Abyss, headphones and cables are not separate products but inseparable elements constituting one perfect signal transmission system.

## **2\. Design and Structure: Functional Beauty or Torture Device?**

The AB-1266 Phi TC's design radiates an intense individuality that cannot be forgotten once seen. It represents a sculptural beauty resulting from pursuing functionality to its extreme, while simultaneously being the source of bewilderment for many users.

### **2.1. Industrial Design and Build Quality**

Upon handling, one is first amazed by its overwhelming material presence. The chassis is entirely made from CNC-machined solid aluminum with durable polymer ceramic coating. No plastic parts are used, promising exceptional rigidity and longevity [12](#ref-12). The ear pads use soft lambskin leather, and the headband features highly cushioned leather, showing no compromise in material selection [14](#ref-14). The product comes in a handcrafted wooden box with an included leather carrying bag, creating the entire packaging as a luxury experience [2](#ref-2).

### **2.2. Convention-Defying Fitting Mechanism**

The greatest factor dividing evaluations of the AB-1266 Phi TC is this unique fitting mechanism. While conventional headphones rely on lateral pressure (clamping force) to secure to the head, this unit is designed to "float above the head and lightly touch the ears" rather than clamp the head [1](#ref-1). To achieve this distinctive fit, users must undertake a complex adjustment process requiring a certain "learning curve" [20](#ref-20).

1. **Width Adjustment:** Users must first physically bend the metal frame above the headband to set the overall width and basic lateral pressure value. While this isn't changed frequently once set, it's extremely important as the first step [12](#ref-12).
2. **Cup Rotation and Angle Adjustment:** Ear cups fixed with powerful magnets can be removed and rotated or tilted front-to-back (toe-in/toe-out). This fine-tunes the seal against the ears [1](#ref-1).
3. **Height Adjustment:** The two-piece headband structure slides to determine vertical positioning [12](#ref-12).

Importantly, this series of adjustments doesn't serve comfort alone but functions as **"mechanical equalization."** The ear cup seal particularly has dramatic effects on sound. Loosening the seal creates a perceived bass reinforcement effect similar to bass reflex, while tightening the seal changes the midrange-treble balance [12](#ref-12).

This design philosophy questions the very definition of headphones as products. While most headphones are designed to provide somewhat consistent sound regardless of who wears them, the AB-1266 involves users as parties in the final tuning process. The act of users personally bending the frame and adjusting cup positions by millimeters amounts to the product's "final assembly." This suggests that the AB-1266 is not a "product" completed when removed from its box, but rather an "instrument" or "tool" whose true value is drawn out through user skill and patience. The extreme reviews found online, ranging from "no bass at all" to "shocking bass," clearly reflect this user-dependent performance characteristic [5](#ref-5). Therefore, criticism of "poor fit" is intimately connected with the possibility that "users haven't found the optimal setting," representing the most fundamental and complex point of discussion when addressing this headphone.

## **3\. Sound Analysis: Exposing the Abyss House Sound**

The AB-1266 Phi TC's sound, like its appearance, is unique. It draws a clear line from conventional headphone sound design, forcing an intense experience upon listeners. Here we analyze its characteristic sound signature by frequency band and approach the true nature of the "Abyss house sound."

### **3.1. Legendary Low End: Physical Impact Experience**

What has made this headphone's name most renowned is its legendary low-frequency reproduction capability. What many reviews commonly describe is not mere quantity but a physical impact that appeals directly to the body beyond hearing. The bass described as "concussive" approaches the air vibrations provided by subwoofers in high-end speaker systems [1](#ref-1).

However, its essence isn't quantity alone. The driver's amazing response speed cleanly delineates complex bassline textures and details without any muddiness. Drum attacks are sharp, reproducing even minute information like subsequent body resonance and skin vibrations [2](#ref-2). As mentioned earlier, this bass quantity can be adjusted by users through ear cup seal adjustment, offering unprecedented flexibility to change according to music and preferences [12](#ref-12).

### **3.2. Midrange and Treble: Transparency and Controversy**

**Midrange:** The AB-1266's midrange is very clean and detail-rich but employs somewhat recessed tuning within the overall balance [12](#ref-12). While this sound design greatly contributes to forming the expansive soundstage described later, listeners prioritizing vocal and mid-instrument warmth and body may find it insufficient [12](#ref-12). This is distinctly not a "warm" sound [12](#ref-12).

**Treble:** The treble extends endlessly with airiness and extremely high resolution. This becomes an important element creating the overall sound's transparency and spaciousness [12](#ref-12). However, this too can be double-edged. Some may find the treble overly emphasized, potentially causing listening fatigue, particularly for treble-sensitive listeners [12](#ref-12). The Phi TC model shows significant sibilance reduction compared to previous models, demonstrating refinement in this area [12](#ref-12).

### **3.3. Soundstage and Imaging: The "Head-Speaker"**

Another pillar alongside the bass is the otherworldly soundstage and imaging. The AB-1266 completely eliminates the sensation of sound occurring inside the head, constructing a vast, three-dimensional acoustic space outside the listener's head [1](#ref-1). Vocals and instruments position with pinpoint accuracy, complete with front-back-left-right and height information, as if listening to properly positioned speakers in a listening room [1](#ref-1). Stereophile's Herb Reichert described the sensation as "like standing where the microphones were placed" [2](#ref-2).

### **3.4. Overall Character and Musicality**

When these elements integrate, the AB-1266 Phi TC's sound becomes incredibly dynamic, fast, transparent, and visceral. Its sound design prioritizes raw resolution, accurate spatial reproduction, and physical impact over tonal naturalness and harmony.

From these characteristics, it demonstrates unmatched strength with specific musical genres. Electronic music, drum and bass, metal, rock, and grand-scale film music that require dynamics and shocking bass represent this headphone's domain [22](#ref-22). Conversely, with genres like piano or acoustic vocals that emphasize natural instrumental tone and rich resonance, evaluations diverge. Some reviews point out that piano sound over-emphasizes the percussive quality of key strikes rather than resonant warmth, with this distinctive tuning becoming a divisive factor [26](#ref-26).

Why is a headphone with such "unnatural" midrange and distinctive tonality praised by some as "lifelike"? The answer lies in psychoacoustics. The radical acoustic presentation that the AB-1266 offers—the massive soundstage extending outside the head and physical bass impact—cleverly deceives the human brain into believing sound is coming from "outside" the head, i.e., from speakers. Once the brain accepts this premise of "listening to speakers," it becomes tolerant of tonal deviations that would be perceived as discomfort with traditional "inside-the-head" headphones.

Thus, the AB-1266 presents listeners with a new "contract": "I don't sound like other headphones. I sound like a private listening room and speaker system for you." For listeners who can accept this contract, the experience can be transcendent. For those who cannot, the sound feels fundamentally "wrong." This is why AB-1266 evaluations polarize to extremes of "love" or "hate." It's not simply a matter of bass or treble preferences but stems from more fundamental differences in recognizing what headphones "should be."

## **4\. Measurement Data and EQ Possibilities: Dialogue with Objective Indicators**

While subjective listening experiences oscillate between enthusiasm and confusion, objective measurement data reveals different aspects of the AB-1266 Phi TC's acoustic characteristics.

### **Measurement Challenges**

Examining measurement data published on sites like Audio Science Review (ASR), the AB-1266 Phi TC's frequency response graph shows an extremely unique shape [18](#ref-18). It differs completely from general target curves (such as the Harman target), with particularly large dips in important midrange-treble regions and irregular peaks and dips throughout the entire graph [18](#ref-18).

<ImageWithCitation

  sourceTitle="Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC Review (Headphone) - ASR"
  sourceUrl="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/abyss-ab-1266-phi-tc-review-headphone.23411/"
/>

However, we must consider the inherent difficulty in measuring this headphone. Its open structure and fitting mechanism that presupposes user adjustment may not be accurately reproduced by standardized measurement equipment (ear simulators) for actual listening experiences [28](#ref-28). Measurement values are merely one indicator requiring careful interpretation.

### **Power Requirements**

The specifications showing 88 dB/mW sensitivity and 47Ω nominal impedance indicate this headphone ranks among the most difficult to drive in the market [14](#ref-14). To extract maximum performance, not only adequate volume but powerful headphone amplifiers capable of supplying high current are essential [1](#ref-1). Some users prefer driving directly from power amplifier speaker terminals rather than headphone outputs [25](#ref-25).

### **Distortion (THD): Potential and Limitations**

The manufacturer's specified total harmonic distortion (THD) is under 1%, further under 0.2% in the most ear-sensitive bands—exceptionally excellent specifications [14](#ref-14). These figures suggest the driver's high basic potential.

However, third-party measurements reveal more complex aspects. Audio Science Review testing reported distortion increases when driven at extremely high volumes beyond normal usage ranges [18](#ref-18). Specifically, high-volume female vocals caused treble distortion creating buzzer-like noise, and bass-heavy tracks produced "ticking" sounds at peaks [18](#ref-18). Some users report distortion when boosting bass with EQ at high volumes [44](#ref-44).

<ImageWithCitation

  sourceTitle="Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC Review (Headphone) - ASR"
  sourceUrl="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/abyss-ab-1266-phi-tc-review-headphone.23411/"
/>

These facts show the headphone's performance limitations while also being the flip side of its exceptional capabilities. The AB-1266 Phi TC demands enormous power to utilize its massive dynamic range. Only when pushed to amplifier limits or the headphone's own physical limits does distortion reveal these boundaries. Like high-performance racing cars showing tire grip or brake performance limits only at ultra-high speeds unattainable by regular cars, the AB-1266 Phi TC shows its physical limitations (distortion) only in extreme performance territories unreachable by ordinary headphones. Importantly, this occurs under extraordinary conditions and doesn't affect normal listening levels [18](#ref-18). Rather, applying EQ to correct frequency response reportedly reduces distortion sensation and improves clarity by suppressing unnecessary peaks [32](#ref-32). This suggests the driver's inherent distortion characteristics are fundamentally excellent.

  sourceUrl="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/abyss-ab-1266-phi-tc-review-headphone.23411/"
/>

### **The Power of Equalization (EQ)**

Here comes the important point. Despite apparently irregular and unbalanced frequency response, the AB-1266 Phi TC shows surprisingly positive reactions to equalization (EQ). ASR reviews reported dramatic sound improvement when using parametric EQ to correct frequency response irregularities [18](#ref-18). The reviewer described post-EQ sound as "wonderful," stating "tonality improved significantly, and the spatial effect was most impressive." Concluding that while not recommended without EQ, with EQ applied, it becomes highly recommended [18](#ref-18).

This fact suggests more than simply "sound changes with EQ." If the driver's inherent performance (transient response, distortion) were poor, EQ application wouldn't solve fundamental problems and would only create unnatural sound. The AB-1266's dramatic and positive transformation through EQ represents objective proof of the driver's technical excellence. It possesses exceptional driver qualities: very low distortion, fast response speed, and massive dynamic range.

This leads to the conclusion that the unusual out-of-box tuning isn't due to technical limitations but represents intentional, artistic choices by designers. Abyss prioritized specific spatial expression even at the sacrifice of tonal neutrality. For users actively utilizing EQ, the AB-1266 offers two worlds. One world experiences the designer's radical acoustic vision directly. Another world sculpts personally preferred, more orthodox yet highest-level sound based on that extraordinary technical potential. The AB-1266 is a headphone where out-of-box "completion" depends heavily on subjective factors while harboring immeasurable "potential."

## **5\. Market Voices: Crossroads of Praise and Criticism**

Few products split evaluations as dramatically as the AB-1266 Phi TC. Its reputation represents a crucible where fervent praise and harsh criticism intersect.

| Media | Quote (Translation + Original) | Rating |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Stereophile](#ref-27) | "JPS headphones must represent the best value in perfectionist audio." | ★★★★★ |
| [The Absolute Sound](#ref-43) | "This is a world-class headphone whose sound quality places it near the top of any list of state-of-the-art contenders." | ★★★★★ |
| [Positive Feedback](#ref-44) | "When driven properly, the Abyss rewards you with an incredible speaker like presentation and deep bass that you can feel." | ★★★★☆ |
| [Audiokey Reviews](#ref-45) | "The Abyss AB1266 Phi TC, however, is on another level altogether... I did not expect... such a commanding gap in performance between it and all others." | ★★★★★ |
| [Head-Fi / Community](#ref-12) | "In general, they have the best, most punchy, and concussive bass on the market." | ★★★★☆ |
| [Passion for Sound (YouTube)](#ref-26) | "It's a fun listen for certain genres... but for $6,000 it's not one I'm going to recommend." (18:15) | ★★★☆☆ |
| [Audio Science Review](#ref-18) | "Without EQ, I cannot recommend the Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC. With EQ, it is a joy and recommended ignoring price." | (No rating) |
| [Reddit (r/headphones)](#ref-5) | "The emperor has no clothes... this headphone makes no sense." | ★☆☆☆☆ |

**Summary:** Analyzing major review sources surveyed, evaluations clearly divide into two camps. One is the **experientialist camp** that praises its unique "experience." Traditional media like Stereophile and The Absolute Sound, along with many forum users, belong here, highly evaluating the expansive soundstage rivaling speakers and physically impactful bass. Their evaluation axis seems to emphasize reproducing music's energy and scale rather than strict tonal fidelity. Confirmation bias justifying expensive investments may be at work in these reviews.

The other is the **objectivist camp** emphasizing objective measurement data. Audio Science Review and some Reddit communities are representative, harshly criticizing irregular frequency response and increased distortion at high volumes. For them, experientialists' praise is viewed as placebo effects or merely personal preferences for colored sound.

This evaluation polarization transcends simple product preferences. Through its unique acoustic characteristics—exceptional dynamics and soundstage combined with distinctive tonal balance—the AB-1266 serves as a litmus test, confronting listeners with the fundamental conflict in high-end audio: should we prioritize "subjective musical experience" or "objective measurement performance"? Evaluating this headphone may be synonymous with declaring one's audio philosophy.

### **Genre-Specific Listening Impressions**

* **Classical Music:** With large orchestras, the vast three-dimensional soundstage and overwhelming dynamics create concert hall-like presence [14](#ref-14). However, somewhat recessed midrange characteristics may cause piano and string instruments to lose natural richness, sounding thin [26](#ref-26). This represents sound prioritizing spatial reproduction and power over tonal accuracy.
* **Jazz:** The new ear pads adopted in CC/TC models improve resolution and separation, depicting stage musician positioning with surprising clarity [46](#ref-46). Sharp transients of percussion and brass represent the high-speed driver's specialty. However, vocal and saxophone warmth and luster may be compromised by distinctive midrange coloration [44](#ref-44).
* **EDM / Rock / Metal:** These genres represent the territory where the AB-1266 truly excels. The visceral bass "slam" that no other headphone can match represents its greatest appeal [12](#ref-12). The overwhelming power, speed, and dynamic impact brings irreplaceable excitement and physical pleasure to rhythm and energy-focused music.

### **The Essence of "Speaker-Like" Metaphor**

What does the frequently used term "speaker-like" in reviews mean? It should be interpreted as achieving two elements that conventional headphones struggle with. First, **physical bass impact** that vibrates air and is felt bodily, not just heard. Second, **expansive soundstage** where sound positions outside rather than inside the head.

The AB-1266's design philosophy appears optimized to maximize these two characteristics. The resulting frequency response irregularities in measurements become secondary concerns, or even intentional tuning results, before this supreme imperative. Many speaker enthusiasts are drawn to this unit because it realizes the physicality and spatiality they seek from speaker systems at the highest level in headphone form [22](#ref-22).

## **6\. Uncompromising Competitor Comparison: Summit Showdown**

The "Summit-Fi" realm where the AB-1266 Phi TC exists is crowded with other formidable competitors possessing unique philosophies and exceptional performance. Here we clarify the AB-1266's positioning through comparison with representatives: the HiFiMan Susvara and Audeze LCD-5.

### **Planar Magnetic Triumvirate: Specification Comparison**

First, we'll overview the basic specifications and market positioning of these three flagship models. This comparison succinctly shows what physical and electrical characteristics each model possesses and what trade-offs they force upon listeners.

| Feature | Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC | [HiFiMan Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/) | [Audeze LCD-5](/en/reviews/audeze-lcd5/) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Price (USD)** | ~$5,995 | ~$6,000 | ~$4,500 |
| **Driver** | 66mm Planar Magnetic | Planar Magnetic (Nanometer Diaphragm) | 90mm Planar Magnetic (Parallel Uniforce) |
| **Weight** | ~640g | ~450g | ~420g |
| **Impedance** | 47 Ω | 60 Ω | 14 Ω |
| **Sensitivity** | 88 dB/mW | 83 dB/mW | 90 dB/mW |
| **Sound Character** | Dynamic, shocking bass, expansive soundstage | Neutral, delicate, natural tonality | Precise, powerful, focused midrange |
| **Fit** | Special, adjustment required, heavy | Very comfortable, lightweight | Very comfortable, class-lightest |

Data Source: [14](#ref-14)

### **vs. [HiFiMan Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/): Colossus of Impact vs. Master of Nuance**

This represents a true clash of acoustic philosophies. While the AB-1266 pursues power, dynamics, and visceral "fun" [22](#ref-22), the [Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/) is worshipped for its neutrality, delicacy, and incredibly natural, uncolored tonality [12](#ref-12). If Abyss is a chest-thumping punch, Susvara is every detail whispered in your ear. Particularly, Susvara's more forward and linear midrange makes it potentially superior for orchestral and vocal-centric music compared to Abyss [12](#ref-12).

Ergonomically, Susvara is significantly lighter at approximately 450g and widely recognized for comfortable long-term listening [34](#ref-34). However, in driving difficulty, Susvara surpasses Abyss with its astounding 83dB sensitivity, demanding enormous amplifier power [33](#ref-33).

### **vs. [Audeze LCD-5](/en/reviews/audeze-lcd5/): Industrialist vs. Modernist**

The [LCD-5](/en/reviews/audeze-lcd5/) symbolizes Audeze's shift from their traditional dark, rich house sound toward more neutral, reference-oriented tuning. Nevertheless, traces of Audeze characteristics remain in powerful, textured bass and dense midrange [37](#ref-37). Compared to the AB-1266, LCD-5's acoustic presentation is more intimate and focused, emphasizing direct approach to sources rather than expansive soundstage outside the head. Against Abyss's vast room simulation, LCD-5 provides more direct, concentrated sound.

In design and ergonomics, LCD-5 achieves class-lightest 420g, contrasting with Abyss's massive construction [36](#ref-36). Its structure utilizing advanced materials like carbon fiber and magnesium represents a modern approach differing from Abyss's brutalist all-metal construction. Fit is also far more orthodox and comfortable for most people right out of the box compared to LCD-5.

## **7\. Value Interrogation: Scales of Absolute Performance and Musicality**

The AB-1266 Phi TC demands much from users in exchange for absolute performance. Judging its value may require more than conventional evaluation axes.

| Evaluation Axis | Score (5 points) | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | ★★★★★ | Incomparable performance in dynamics, speed, and resolution. Capability to construct vast, layered soundstage is state-of-the-art, depicting minute details rivaling electrostatics [45](#ref-45). |
| **Musical Appeal** | ★★★☆☆ / ★★★★★(specific genres) | Extremely genre-dependent with divided evaluations. Provides ultimate experience (★★★★★) with high-energy music like EDM and rock, but distinctive midrange becomes major weakness with classical or vocal jazz emphasizing natural tonality (★★☆☆☆) [12](#ref-12). |
| **Build Quality** | ★★★★★ | Highest grade. Chassis machined from solid aluminum suggests lifetime durability. Evaluated as among the world's most robustly built headphones. |
| **Price-Value** | ★☆☆☆☆ | Extremely low from conventional perspectives. Considering expensive main unit price plus essential high-performance amplifier and controversial tuning, it's hardly a rational choice. Cheaper products offer more neutral, versatile performance [18](#ref-18). |
| **Future-Proofing / Repairability** | ★★★★☆ | Robust construction enables long-term use. Manufacturer has historically provided driver, ear pad, and headband upgrades, showing commitment to maintaining long-term investment value [9](#ref-9). However, repairs will be expensive and likely require return to origin country. |

### **Balance of Positive/Negative Elements**

* **Positive Elements:** World-class dynamics and "slam," breathtaking resolution, expansive speaker-like soundstage, incomparable build quality, and unique exciting musical experience.
* **Negative Elements:** Extremely high price point, distinctive fit uncomfortable for many, colored and recessed midrange, high sensitivity to placement position, and requirement for very powerful, expensive amplification. Additionally, the manufacturer's sale of expensive accessory cables draws skeptical views from some audiophiles [5](#ref-5).

Here we must return to manufacturing parent JPS Labs' philosophy. Clear contradiction exists between their pursuit of "absolute neutrality" in cables and the distinctive sound signature shown by flagship headphone AB-1266. Does this mean different philosophies exist between cable and headphone divisions within the company, or does "neutrality" or "realism" in transducers mean something different from measurement flatness for them—perhaps most faithfully transmitting music's energy? How this fundamental contradiction is interpreted will significantly change AB-1266 evaluations.

## **8\. Conclusion: For Those Who Gaze Into the Abyss**

In conclusion, the AB-1266 doesn't participate in races for a single throne of "best headphone." It's a heretic rejecting the compromises of balance and universality that competing products aim for, walking its own path. In the unparalleled territory of "slam" and "speaker-like spatial expression" in headphones, it reigns as an undisputed king. For listeners seeking that specific, otherwise unattainable experience, it becomes the final destination product. Truly worthy of the title "solitary heretic."

  * Those seeking versatile headphones handling all genres.
  * Those seeking rational cost-performance.

Its modular structure (ear pads, headband) and manufacturer's historical approach suggest future evolution possibilities. Third-party accessories offer additional tuning potential, but this means additional investment.

The AB-1266 Phi TC is definitely not for everyone. However, for those resonating with its design philosophy and prepared to meet its demands, it promises a unique experience no other headphone can provide—like peering into music's abyss.

### **Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3.5)**

This rating reflects the fact that this unit is a brilliant but deeply flawed specialized product. While it offers five-star experience for specific narrow audiences, it can represent one-star proposal for many others. The average, though controversial, must land on an honest middle ground.

Listeners prioritizing tonal neutrality, midrange warmth, out-of-box comfort, or system compatibility will find greater satisfaction in Susvara or LCD-5. The AB-1266 Phi TC isn't a universal reference machine but a professional tool pursuing specific objectives to extremes. It represents the ultimate destination (endgame) for the select few listeners seeking not just to hear music but to "feel" it in the deepest, most physical form possible.
