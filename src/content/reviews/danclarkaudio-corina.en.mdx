In the world of audio, electrostatic headphones have existed as a kind of sanctuary. The promise that a diaphragm with virtually no mass can move faster and with less distortion than any other drive system. It has been spoken of as the most certain path to stripping away the final veil from the information recorded in the source, reaching pure acoustic truth. However, in exchange for this ascetic transparency, the criticism has always followed this solitary technology—that it often leaves behind the pulsating vitality of music with blood running through its veins, namely the "soul." This fundamental contradiction between technical perfection and musical sensuality is undoubtedly one of the eternal themes in high-end audio.

Against this profound question, Dan Clark Audio (DCA) emerged carrying a clear answer. This brand, which began its career as MrSpeakers by modifying Fostex planar magnetic headphones, has embodied the engineering obsession of founder Dan Clark [1](#ref-1). Their history has always been directed toward solving specific acoustic problems. Giving closed-back headphones the soundstage of open-back ones [2](#ref-2), and precisely controlling the acoustic characteristics of planar magnetic headphones through metamaterials. Having proven their skill with masterpieces like STEALTH and [EXPANSE](/en/reviews/danclarkaudio-expanse), their choice of the electrostatic world as their next challenge was perhaps inevitable.

And now, what stands before us is the CORINA. This is not a product simply aiming to create a "better [STAX](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000)." Rather, it's an ambitious attempt to reconstruct DCA's "house sound"—precisely controlled, musically rich, and refined enough to endure long listening sessions—cultivated with planar magnetics, on the entirely different platform of electrostatic drivers. The purpose of this review is to thoroughly reveal whether this cross-breeding succeeded, whether it carves new paths in electrostatic drive, or whether it's a compromise between ideals and reality. What is CORINA trying to make us hear? What philosophy breathes in the sound beyond? Let us begin our journey of contemplation.

These numbers are merely starting points—CORINA's true value should be found within innovative technologies that cannot be fully expressed in spec sheets.

## **1. Crossroads of Public Opinion: Discourse Surrounding CORINA**

Since its debut, CORINA has sparked active discussions within the audio community. Here, to grasp the overall picture of this discourse, we survey major reviews and organize common points and differences in evaluation.

| Media | Quoted Extract (Translation + Original) | Key Points of Evaluation | Bias Assessment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Headfonics](https://headfonics.com/dan-clark-audio-corina-review/) | "The Dan Clark Audio CORINA has a very smooth tone and a surprisingly weighty sound signature for an electrostatic headphone." | Highly praises the rich, natural tone and comfortable fit. Suggests it may resonate more with planar magnetic users than traditional electrostatic fans. | Relatively neutral. Although it's a review based on manufacturer-provided samples, it clearly describes both strengths and weaknesses (such as driving difficulty), making it highly reliable. |
| [Headfonia](https://www.headfonia.com/dca-corina-review/) | "To me the DCA Corina is one of the most musical, engaging and natural sounding electrostatic headphones I have had the pleasure to listen to." | Praises the musical enjoyment and natural tonality. Particularly evaluates midrange expressiveness and versatility across all genres. | Leans positive. Shows enthusiasm by awarding a Best of Show Award, but the reasoning is logically explained. Also mentions amp compatibility, making it helpful. |
| [The Absolute Sound (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0fktYlkkBs) | "The Corinas deliver a balanced response that is open and detailed and revealing but they do this in a natural and forgiving way." (01:12-01:23) | Points out the forgiveness that breathes life into old recordings rather than punishing them. Analyzes this as the result of low distortion and skillful design. | Calm-toned evaluation by an experienced reviewer. No impression of a puff piece, accurately capturing the product's essence. |
| [Headphone.Guru](https://headphone.guru/corina-reference-electrostatic-headphone-from-the-team-at-dan-clark-audio/) | "The CORINA is possibly the best transducer in the world currently available in electrostatic design." | Highly evaluates overwhelming resolution, dynamic range, and genre-agnostic versatility. Concludes it offers value commensurate with the price. | Extremely positive. Note that this is a review in an ultra-high-end environment with a total system cost of approximately $19,000, evaluating performance at its maximum potential. |
| [Major HiFi](https://majorhifi.com/dan-clark-audio-corina-review/) | "its massive and jarringly accurate sound stage may be one feature that could impress seasoned audio files and newbies alike." | Highlights thoroughly neutral sound quality and holographic, expansive soundstage as key features. | Balanced review. Particularly excellent soundstage description. However, the lack of comparison with [Audeze CRBN](/en/reviews/audeze-crbn2) is regrettable. |
| [Head-Case.org User "Spritzer"](https://www.head-case.org/forums/topic/27014-dan-clark-corina-electrostatic/) | "They are like the headphones for people who hate how electrostatics sound.... On some tracks they are simply claustrophobic, almost if you are listening through thick cloth." | Severely criticizes DCA's damping implementation. Questions artificial midrange resonance and narrow soundstage. Also raises doubts about build quality. | Extremely critical. From the perspective of a hardcore DIY community, taking a purist stance that condemns the manufacturer's intended tuning as "excessive damping." While technically insightful, it carries strong bias. |

Compilation and Analysis:
Synthesizing over 10 sources surveyed, evaluations are clearly bipolar. Positive evaluations account for about 80% of the total, with particularly glowing voices from professional reviewers. Common praise points include:
**①Smooth, natural tone without the harsh highs characteristic of traditional electrostatics** [6](#ref-6)
**②Rich, vibrant midrange and vocal expression** [4](#ref-4)
**③Exceptional for electrostatics: substantial and impactful bass response** [7](#ref-7)

On the other hand, cutting-edge communities like Head-Case.org deliver completely opposite evaluations. The core of their criticism lies in the **AMTS (Acoustic Metamaterial Tuning System) damping** that determines CORINA's acoustic characteristics [10](#ref-10). What professional reviewers praise as "smoothness" and "naturalness" in acoustic control, they condemn as "excessive damping" that robs the driver of its inherent vitality and openness.

This evaluation divergence suggests a deeper structure beyond mere preference differences. CORINA appears to function as a "litmus test" reflecting listeners' audio philosophy. On one side are those who view headphones as refined tools for enjoying music comfortably over long periods. For them, CORINA's tuning is ideal. On the other side exist analytical listeners who make it their supreme mission to extract source information as-is, sometimes with ear-piercing sharpness. To them, CORINA's sound may feel "too tamed." This axis of opposition becomes the most important key to understanding CORINA.

## **2. Philosophy of Design: AMTS and Structural Evolution**

CORINA's acoustic design can be summarized in one keyword: "control." DCA has attempted to perfectly control the electrostatic driver—a spirited, noble thoroughbred—with the reins of cutting-edge acoustic engineering. At its core is AMTS (Acoustic Metamaterial Tuning System), which has already established high praise in the company's flagship models.

AMTS — Conductor of Acoustic Chaos
Inside headphone cups, high-frequency standing waves tend to occur, causing unnatural peaks, harshness, and listening fatigue in the sound [3](#ref-3). AMTS is DCA's patent-pending technology developed to solve this problem. This complex structure placed between the driver and ear integrates waveguides, diffusion control, quarter-wave resonators, and Helmholtz resonators—essentially a passive acoustic filter [9](#ref-9). This selectively absorbs and diffuses disturbed high-frequency energy, smoothing frequency response. CORINA's AMTS implementation represents nothing less than a clear expression of purpose: to fundamentally eliminate the "treble glare" characteristic of electrostatics and achieve natural, accurate mid-to-high frequencies.

System-wide Precision Pursuit
DCA's obsession with "control" doesn't stop at AMTS.

* **Driver Redesign:** CORINA's 88mm driver, while the same size as the previous VOCE model, incorporates a new tension system to maintain more uniform diaphragm tension. This improves linearity and enhances left-right channel matching precision [3](#ref-3).
* **Ear Pad Matching:** This attempt, probably industry-first, symbolizes DCA's philosophy [4](#ref-4). By matching not just drivers but ear pads—which significantly affect sound quality—in left-right pairs, they aim to eliminate manufacturing variations to the extreme.
* **Comfort Evolution:** The headband adopts the self-adjusting suspension structure using titanium alloy and Nitinol (shape memory alloy) that earned acclaim in STEALTH and [EXPANSE](/en/reviews/danclarkaudio-expanse) [6](#ref-6). The new hybrid ear pads use synthetic suede on skin-contact surfaces, designed to reduce stuffiness and discomfort during extended use [4](#ref-4).

Each of these elements shows that DCA does not accept reliance on chance, seeking to bring every variable affecting acoustics under engineering control. CORINA represents the culmination of this design philosophy. It's a grand and meticulous acoustic control system for making the electrostatic driver—often likened to a capricious diva—sing according to perfect acoustic targets.

**Technical Specification Comparison with Competitors**

| Feature | Dan Clark Audio CORINA | [STAX SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000) | [Audeze CRBN](/en/reviews/audeze-crbn2) | DCA VOCE (Previous Model) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Driver Type | Electrostatic | Electrostatic | Electrostatic | Electrostatic |
| Driver Size | 88mm (circular) | ⌀145mm equivalent (large circular) | 90mm (oval) | 88mm (circular) |
| Weight | 465g | 432g | 470g | 330g |
| Ear Pad Material | Synthetic leather / Suede | Genuine leather (sheepskin) | Genuine leather | Genuine leather |
| Headband Structure | Self-adjusting (Titanium/Nitinol) | Arc/slider type (stainless steel) | Self-adjusting (Carbon/Magnesium) | Slider type (Nitinol) |
| Price (USD) | $4,499 | $6,200 | $4,500 | $3,300 |

From this table, we see that while CORINA is equivalent or slightly heavier than competitors in weight, it holds an advantage in comfort with its self-adjusting headband. The 135g weight increase from the previous VOCE model can be considered the price for AMTS addition and more robust headband construction [6](#ref-6). Price positioning directly competes with [Audeze CRBN](/en/reviews/audeze-crbn2) and is strategically positioned clearly lower than STAX's flagship [SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000).

## **3. Acoustic Objectivity Revealed by Measurement Data**

Stepping away from subjective listening impressions and turning to objective measurement data, CORINA's design philosophy becomes clearer. Third-party measurement results support the sound signature DCA aimed for.

### Frequency Response
Analyzing frequency response graphs published by sources like TechPowerUp confirms that CORINA differs from traditional electrostatics, possessing characteristics close to the Harman Target Curve [7](#ref-7). Particularly, the pinna gain peak at 1-3kHz and smooth rolloff toward high frequencies are evidence of modern tuning. Bass extends well into sub-bass regions without excessive boost, maintaining natural balance for an open-back design [14](#ref-14). Most notably in the highs, AMTS's effect is tremendous—sharp peaks and dips seen in many other headphones are effectively suppressed, showing extremely smooth response [3](#ref-3).

  sourceTitle="Dan Clark Audio CORINA Frequency Response - TechPowerUp"
  sourceUrl="https://www.techpowerup.com/review/dan-clark-audio-corina-electrostatic-headphones/4.html"
/>

### Distortion
The greatest beauty of electrostatic drivers—low distortion characteristics—remains intact in CORINA. Distortion is kept extremely low across all frequencies, providing the basis for sound transparency and clean reproduction capability even at high volumes [15](#ref-15). Users report that the reproduction is so clean they "unconsciously turn up the volume too high" [15](#ref-15).

### Channel Matching
DCA's policy of driver and ear pad matching is clearly reflected in measurement results. Left-right channel frequency responses match almost perfectly, demonstrating extremely high manufacturing precision difficult to achieve in mass-produced products [11](#ref-11). This ensures stable, accurate sound imaging [11](#ref-11).

### The Gap Between Measurement and Perception
However, these near-"perfect" measurement results don't necessarily mean "perfect sound" for all listeners—this is both the profundity of audio and the core of CORINA's controversy. While measurement data excels at capturing static characteristics like frequency-specific sound pressure and distortion, it cannot fully express more dynamic, perceptual aspects like transient response sharpness or soundstage spatial expansion.

The "claustrophobic soundstage" and "lackluster sound" pointed out by Head-Case.org users [10](#ref-10) may stem from this measurement-perception gap. In other words, while AMTS's thorough damping smooths measurement-based frequency characteristics, it may slightly spoil the driver's subtle movements and airiness, leading experienced listeners to perceive it as "over-damped" sound. CORINA's existence poses questions to us: Is audio's goal to draw ideal curves on measurement graphs, or to unleash driver constraints and pursue raw vitality? There is no single absolute answer to this question.

## **4. Portrait of Sound: Listening Impressions**

Based on objective data, let us finally turn our ears to the sound CORINA itself produces. Various reviewers' words paint a multifaceted portrait of this headphone's appeal.

| Reviewer / Media | Quoted Extract (Translation + Original) |
| :---- | :---- |
| [The Absolute Sound (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0fktYlkkBs) | "for example the 1958 recording the scene changes with Bud Powell has a typical early stereo era balance that's a little rolled off in the bass and treble but sounds detailed and enjoyable on the Corinas. they don't punish you for liking old pre-dolby recordings." (00:39-00:57) |
| [Headphone.Guru](https://headphone.guru/dan-clark-audio-corina-electrostatic-headphone-review/) | "Vocals were in the room natural, with an intimate yet massive in-studio soundstage. … The upright bass held a realism I simply haven't experienced with headphones." |
| [Audio Science Review Forum User](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/dca-corina-announced-new-electrostatic-headphone.42771/page-3) | "EVERYTHING in the mix is "separable" when listening. I can hear it all and focus my attention on separate elements in the sound if I like." |

Integrating these testimonies with personal listening experience, I sketch this sound portrait by genre.

**Classical / Jazz**
This may be the domain where CORINA's true value shines most. String instrument harmonics are rich yet ear-piercing sharpness (edge) is skillfully suppressed, melting into space with silk-like smoothness. With large orchestras, its astounding separation ability is displayed, making the positional relationships of each instrumental section crystal clear [15](#ref-15). However, this isn't analytical coldness but presented as a harmoniously balanced musical whole. In jazz trios, the realism of wood bass resonance [8](#ref-8), cymbal decay delicacy, and piano touch nuances emerge from an ink-black background. This must result from electrostatic speed and low distortion characteristics combining with AMTS's natural tonality.

**Rock / EDM**
In genres considered "weak points" of electrostatics, CORINA overturns conventional wisdom. The "really kicking bass" the manufacturer claims [9](#ref-9) is no empty boast. While its low end lacks the ground-hugging sub-bass or physically impactful punch of top-tier planar magnetics, it's extremely fast, tight, and adequately substantial. This gives rock rhythm sections solid propulsion and makes EDM synth bass articulate precise pitches without bloat. Even with energy-dense music where many electrostatics struggle, CORINA never saturates, calmly handling the sound deluge. This represents extremely modern balance sensibility as a tool for musical enjoyment.

**Vocals**
Commonly praised across all reviews is the wonderful vocal expression. Superlatives like "rich," "lush," and "most natural among electrostatics heard" abound [3](#ref-3). Voices position at exquisite distances—neither with excessive forward "shout" nor receding too far back. Male and female voices alike transmit textural qualities and subtle breath nuances with startling vividness. This must result from Harman Target-conscious midrange tuning and smooth high-frequency characteristics that eliminate unnecessary peaks.

Overall, the sound portrait CORINA paints deserves the phrase "refined equilibrium." It's a new sound that preserves traditional electrostatic virtues of speed and resolution while fusing musical enjoyment and comfort demanded by modern music listeners. A high-resolution headphone created not for analysis but for pure musical immersion. This appears to be CORINA's essence.

## **5. Scales of Value: Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**

Based on analysis thus far, I comprehensively judge CORINA's value from multiple evaluation axes.

| Evaluation Axis | Score (5-point scale) | Commentary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | ★★★★☆ | **Strengths:** World-class resolution, near-zero distortion, and near-perfect channel matching. AMTS is a breakthrough solution in acoustic engineering.<br/>**Weaknesses:** Lower efficiency compared to competitors, requiring powerful dedicated amplifiers [6](#ref-6). Damping for smooth frequency response may feel like dynamics suppression to some listeners [10](#ref-10). |
| **Musical Appeal** | ★★★★☆ | **Strengths:** Exceptionally smooth, natural, and fatigue-free sound transforms any genre into a supreme experience. Particularly beautiful midrange and forgiving nature that doesn't expose recording flaws makes it perfect for long musical immersion.<br/>**Weaknesses:** Purists seeking traditional "[STAX sound](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000)" with penetrating airiness and sharpness may find it somewhat lacking [6](#ref-6). |
| **Build Quality** | ★★★★☆ | **Strengths:** Generous use of premium materials like titanium and aluminum. Cup finishing is exquisite. Self-adjusting headband is proven comfortable design.<br/>**Weaknesses:** 465g weight is not light [6](#ref-6). Some users' criticisms about headband "squeaking" and pad texture quality cannot be completely ignored, preventing perfect score [10](#ref-10). |
| **Price-to-Value** | ★★★☆☆ | **Strengths:** Lower pricing than direct rival [STAX SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000) (\$6,200) [17](#ref-17). Provides highly designed unique sound.<br/>**Weaknesses:** $4,500 price remains substantial investment requiring equally expensive amplifiers. [Audeze CRBN](/en/reviews/audeze-crbn2) exists as strong competitor, preventing automatic choice and requiring deliberation. |
| **Future-proofing / Repairability** | ★★★★☆ | **Strengths:** DCA is an established company with expected support structure. Cables are user-replaceable [6](#ref-6).<br/>**Weaknesses:** AMTS's complex structure may hinder third-party repair or modification. Dust intrusion concerns during disassembly have been noted [10](#ref-10). |

Bias Check:
Evaluations of this unit are predominantly positive. While evidence of the product's very high completion level, possibility of favorable bias toward review samples cannot be denied. Conversely, criticisms seen in cutting-edge forums, though technically grounded, can also be viewed as reverse bias due to adherence to specific acoustic philosophy. In conclusion, CORINA is an intentionally "biased" product whose design philosophy itself chooses listeners. Its value is deeply connected to individual philosophies of what listeners seek from audio.

## **6. Challenge to Silence: CORINA's Market Significance**

Today's high-end electrostatic headphone market is no longer [STAX's](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000) exclusive domain. With [Audeze CRBN](/en/reviews/audeze-crbn2) and this DCA CORINA's emergence, we've entered an era of unprecedented diversity. To understand this situation, let me classify top models by their design philosophies into three types.

1. Purist - [STAX SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000):
   The orthodox path pursuing traditional electrostatic ideals. Values incomparable speed, transparency, and airiness as supreme, accepting that high-frequency sharpness accompanies as part of "truth" [16](#ref-16). For better or worse, it's the standard against which all electrostatics should be compared—the benchmark.

2. Hybridist - [Audeze CRBN](/en/reviews/audeze-crbn2):
   The innovator intentionally fusing electrostatic speed with planar magnetic impact and tonal richness. Aiming for richer, lower-centered, forward presentation, ultimately creating "Audeze-sounding electrostatics" [18](#ref-18).

3. Modernist - Dan Clark Audio CORINA:
   The third path using cutting-edge AMTS acoustic engineering to actively "correct" elements considered traditional electrostatic "flaws." Prioritizing smoothness over sharpness, modern tonal balance conforming to Harman Target over airiness [7](#ref-7).

Within this structure, CORINA's significance is extremely clear. It represents DCA's answer to modern audiophiles' demand: **wanting to enjoy electrostatic potential (resolution, low distortion) while rejecting its historical negative legacy (high-frequency stimulation, lightweight bass)**. It's a strategic product intended to open electrostatic doors to broader audiences—users accustomed to planar magnetic sound—different from traditional electrostatic fans. CORINA is an important stone advancing electrostatic "modernization," not "popularization."

## **7. Conclusion: Sound for Whom?**

Dan Clark Audio CORINA is a headphone that should be called an engineering triumph, achieving unprecedentedly smooth, natural, and musically appealing sound on an electrostatic platform using innovative AMTS technology. Its greatest strength—thoroughly controlled, forgiving sound—simultaneously becomes the biggest point of controversy among purists.

**Those Who Can Appreciate This Sound**

* Audiophiles who love electrostatic detail and speed but suffer from high-frequency listening fatigue.
* Users seeking the next step in resolution without losing planar magnetic musicality.
* Listeners prioritizing long musical immersion and natural tonality over analytical listening.

**Those Who Should Avoid This Sound**

* Traditional STAX fans who consider the unique sharpness called "STAX edge" and maximum airiness supreme.
* Listeners seeking sharp, analytical, ultra-high-resolution presentations as proof of "high-end" status.
* Those hesitant about additional investment in powerful, expensive dedicated amplifiers.

Future-proofing and Modification Potential
The existence of modification discussed on Head-Case.org to remove damping material (dubbed "un-fuck mod") is intriguing [10](#ref-10). While not recommended practice, it evidences CORINA's intentionally "tamed" nature and the community's desire to unleash the driver's raw potential.

### Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

Dan Clark Audio CORINA is a masterpiece perfectly embodying specific acoustic philosophy. However, it's also true that this philosophy isn't universal. It exists not as a universal benchmark but as a clear-willed "choice." For all modern audiophiles who respect electrostatic history while believing its future need not extend past lines, CORINA possesses irresistible appeal. This is an invitation to a courageous challenge—spinning new lyrical poetry from silence.
