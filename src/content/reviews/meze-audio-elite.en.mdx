When striving to reach the pinnacle of audio equipment, what we face is not merely a contest of "functions." It is nothing less than a dialogue with a work of art—a condensation of the designer's philosophy, aesthetic sense, and worldview toward the phenomenon of sound itself. Meze Audio, born from Romanian soil, can truly be called a rare brand that embodies this philosophy. What they advocate is the "antifragility of classics"—timeless design unswayed by trends—and the creation of products as "heirlooms" passed down through generations [1](#ref-1).

The Meze Audio Elite we examine today represents the current pinnacle of this philosophy. The market is crowded with fierce competitors pursuing single performance metrics to their limits—resolution, driving power, or the expressive capability of specific frequency ranges. In such circumstances, what value does the Elite propose? Perhaps it lies in harmonizing all elements that constitute the listening experience—acoustic performance, comfort, and the joy of ownership—at an extremely high level. This article aims to delve into the depths of the Meze Audio Elite using this question as our guiding compass.

## **Chapter One: Voices from Around the World — Review Summary**

Elite has captured attention from audiophiles worldwide, with evaluations generally filled with praise while simultaneously sparking lively debates about its distinctive character.

| Media | Quote Excerpt (Translation + Original) | Rating & Bias Assessment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Headfonia](https://www.headfonia.com/review-meze-audio-empyrean-elite/4/) | "The ELITE is more Fun, and the HE-1000SE is more neutrally precise." | ★★★★☆ Well-balanced comparison by experienced reviewer. High likelihood of review sample provision, but analysis is objective. |
| [Twister6](https://twister6.com/2023/11/11/meze-audio-elite-tungsten/2/) | "Meze Elite has a coloured, musical signature that goes for a fuller bodied and sparkly colour over a neutral reference approach." | ★★★★☆ Technically in-depth review with measurement data. Explicitly states personal preference for reference tuning, lending high credibility. |
| [Headphones.com Forum](https://forum.headphones.com/t/meze-audio-elite-flagship-open-back-planar-magnetic-headphones/14284?page=5) | "The ELITE bring more detail, better dynamic performance, and better overall coherency to the table." | ★★★★★ Owner impressions. Possible confirmation bias, but practical context and direct comparisons are highly valuable. |
| [Reddit User](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/wtnwmg/heard_lcd5_meze_elite_and_susvara_at_hifibuys/) | "The Elite is materially slower and less resolving - thus certain music components sound like they are jumboed together..." | ★★★☆☆ Brief direct comparison at a show. Possible bias due to unfamiliar playback environment and short listening time. |

**Summary:** Synthesizing these reviews, Elite is consistently highly rated for its incomparable comfort, artistic build quality, and musical sound that doesn't fatigue during extended listening. However, when compared to the most analytical competing products, absolute resolution and transient sharpness tend to become points of debate. This can be seen as a reflection of Elite's emphasis on a more comprehensive musical experience rather than pure technical performance pursuit.

## **Chapter Two: Philosophy of Acoustic Design — Technical Insights**

To understand Elite's sound, we must examine its heart—the innovative driver technology.

### **Rinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array® Driver**

The MZ3SE driver that Elite employs, co-developed with Ukraine's Rinaro, can be said to have opened new possibilities for planar magnetic drivers without exaggeration [7](#ref-7). Its greatest feature lies in the hybrid structure placing two types of voice coils on a single diaphragm.

* **Dual Coil System:** The upper portion of the diaphragm features "switchback coils" efficient for low-frequency reproduction, while the central portion directly facing the ear canal contains "spiral coils" specialized for mid-high frequency reproduction [8](#ref-8). This design philosophy resembles the role division between woofers and tweeters in speakers. Particularly, by placing spiral coils handling frequencies above 10 kHz directly above the ear canal, it aims to maximize direct sound wave transmission and dramatically improve 3D imaging and spatial localization precision [8](#ref-8).
* **Parus® Diaphragm:** Supporting this dual coil system is the newly developed "Parus®" diaphragm. Made from ultra-thin biaxially stretched semi-crystalline polymer film, it achieves an astonishing lightweight design of just 0.11 g [8](#ref-8). This low mass becomes the source of the vast frequency response extending to 112 kHz and excellent transient response performance.

### **Physical Structure Reaching Artistic Heights**

Meze's philosophy permeates not only the drivers but every element comprising the headphones. The CNC-machined frame carved from a single aluminum block over approximately 20 hours, lightweight yet high-rigidity carbon fiber headband, and patented suspension wing system—all meticulously calculated to achieve ultimate comfort during extended use [1](#ref-1).

Here, a question arises: Doesn't the design of housing two different coils on one diaphragm theoretically risk compromising sound "coherence (consistency)"? Indeed, some users have pointed out concerns in this regard [12](#ref-12). However, this should be viewed not as a flaw but as an intentional design trade-off. The purpose of this design is to achieve unparalleled spatial reproduction by precisely delivering high-frequency sound sources to the eardrum [8](#ref-8). The vast, holographic soundstage praised by many reviewers [9](#ref-9) is none other than proof that this design succeeded. In other words, Meze and Rinaro chose more advanced spatial reconstruction capability in exchange for the absolute tonal unity that single coils possess. Rather than "lack of coherence" as some point out, this might be called a triumph of spatial acoustic engineering.

### **Competitors at the Summit: Spec Comparison**

### **Objective Performance from Measurement Data**

While subjective listening impressions are undoubtedly the core of audio reviews, objective measurement data provides valuable compass points that support those impressions and serve as starting points for discussion.

Meze Audio claims Elite's total harmonic distortion (THD) is below 0.05% across the entire frequency range—an ambitious figure suggesting extremely clean reproduction capability [5](#ref-5). Independent third-party measurements also support this claim.

<ImageWithCitation

  sourceTitle="Meze Audio Elite Headphones - SoundStage!"
  sourceUrl="https://www.soundstagenetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2615:meze-audio-elite-headphones&catid=263&Itemid=203"
/>

According to *SoundStage! Solo* measurements, Elite's distortion is at "essentially non-existent" levels, which is characteristic of high-performance planar magnetic headphones [27](#ref-27).

Looking at frequency response, Elite's character becomes clearer. The characteristics when wearing hybrid pads (leather/Alcantara) fall within the standard range for open-back planar magnetic headphones, but show a notable peak around 3.5kHz [27](#ref-27). This characteristic likely contributes to the "airiness" and "clarity" that many reviewers point out. More interesting is the strong resonance observed around 330Hz. This might be interpreted as physical backing for the "punchy bass" mentioned in subjective impressions [27](#ref-27).

<ImageWithCitation
  imagePath={mesurementGraph}
  sourceTitle="Meze Audio Elite Headphones - SoundStage!"
  sourceUrl="https://www.soundstagenetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2615:meze-audio-elite-headphones&catid=263&Itemid=203"
/>

The effect of ear pad swapping, one of Elite's most unique features, is also dramatic in measurement data. Switching to Alcantara pads significantly reduces bass below 800Hz while also changing mid-high frequency characteristics [27](#ref-27). This demonstrates that Elite is not a product with a single sound signature, but rather a kind of modular system where users can physically adjust acoustic characteristics.

  sourceTitle="Meze Audio Elite Headphones - SoundStage!"
  sourceUrl="https://www.soundstagenetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2615:meze-audio-elite-headphones&catid=263&Itemid=203"
/>

Impedance and phase show almost perfectly flat characteristics, also typical of planar magnetic drivers [27](#ref-27). This means sound quality changes due to amplifier output impedance are extremely minimal, guaranteeing stable performance.

Overall, measurement data shows Elite is built upon an extremely excellent technical foundation. Upon this, it intentionally adjusts specific frequency bands (3.5kHz peak and 330Hz resonance) while leaving room for significant characteristic changes through ear pad swapping, clearly revealing Meze's design philosophy of prioritizing musical enjoyment and user customization over strict neutrality [16](#ref-16).

## **Chapter Three: Soul Resonance — Listening Impressions**

Having understood the technical background, let us now turn our ears to the musical world that Elite creates.

| Reviewer / Media | Quote Excerpt (Translation + Original) |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Headmania](https://headmania.org/2022/01/05/meze-elite-headphones-review/) | "The harp gave me goose bumps, then the voice entered the scene with an incredible presence and clarity... Everything happens in a very holographic and spacious soundstage." |
| [AudioRabbitHole](https://audiorabbithole.com/meze-elite-with-arctic-cables-grandis/) | "The sub and mid-bass is less about visceral impact and slam, and more about tasteful control and refinement... the lower end retains a warm tint, but is now presented without any bloat." |
| [MajorHiFi](https://majorhifi.com/elite-flagship-hybrid-array-planar-headphone-review/) | "It almost feels effortless on the part of the headphones. When certain hard effects appeared on the soundtracks it took me back, as I was not expecting the sound to happen as if it was right in front of me." |

### **Genre-Specific Sound Quality Analysis**

**Classical / Orchestral:** This is likely one of the genres where Elite's true value shines brightest. Its vast and deep soundstage beautifully recreates the atmosphere of concert halls [9](#ref-9). The excellent separation provided by hybrid drivers clearly delineates each instrument's parts, though in extremely complex tutti passages, it may yield a step to more analytical headphones [15](#ref-15). However, this might be seen not as a flaw but as an expression of Elite's character that prioritizes overall musical harmony.

**Jazz / Acoustic:** What shines here is the natural, rich timbre. Particularly female vocals, guitars, and piano resonance are vividly rendered, conveying even the performer's breathing and fingertip nuances [9](#ref-9). The warm, never piercing highs and rich yet outline-preserving mids draw out the "emotion" inherent in music without reservation.

**Rock / Electronic:** Elite's bass is not the type that overwhelms with quantity. It is controlled, deep-diving, refined bass [13](#ref-13). The mid-bass bloat sometimes noted in the previous Empyrean model has been resolved, with no image blurring even in fast-paced tracks [9](#ref-9). However, listeners seeking gut-punching "slam" may find it somewhat underwhelming.

### **Ear Pads as Physical Equalizers**

Elite's package includes two types of ear pads with different characteristics (hybrid, Alcantara) [7](#ref-7). These are not mere accessories. As Meze proclaims to "calibrate your sound" [8](#ref-8), this is an extremely analog tuning system for users to adjust sound quality themselves. According to reviews, hybrid pads improve sub-bass extension while Alcantara pads enhance mid-high frequency directivity [16](#ref-16). This approach of changing sound through physical material properties rather than relying on digital EQ strongly reflects Meze's philosophy emphasizing craftsmanship and material feel. This can be called an invitation to mature audio enjoyment that respects listener sensibility and autonomy.

## **Chapter Four: Scales of Value — Evaluation**

Evaluating Elite from multiple angles reveals its unique value proposition.

| Evaluation Axis | Score (out of 5) | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Technical Performance | 4.0 / 5 | Possesses excellent resolution and soundstage, but doesn't reach the ultimate detail and dynamics that specialist competitors like [Susvara](/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled) or [LCD-5](/reviews/audeze-lcd5) provide. Its core technical strength lies in unique spatial expression capability. |
| Musical Appeal | 4.2 / 5 | Smooth, natural, and non-fatiguing tuning provides incredibly attractive and emotional long-term listening experiences across many genres. |
| Build Quality | 5.0 / 5 | Flawless. Material selection including CNC-machined aluminum and carbon fiber, ergonomic design, and craftsmanship set industry standards. A true luxury object [1](#ref-1). |
| Price-Performance Value | 3.0 / 5 | Flagship-level pricing. Value derives not just from sound but from comprehensive package including comfort, aesthetic beauty, accessories, and usability. High value for users seeking this total experience, but more attractive options exist for pure cost-performance pursuit. |
| Future-proofing / Repairability | 4.7 / 5 | Designed as "heirlooms." Replaceable parts and repair-oriented structure guarantee exceptional longevity in contrast to the disposable nature of many electronic devices [17](#ref-17). |

### **Evaluation Summary**

* **Positive Elements:**
  * Incomparable comfort and build quality
  * Vast, holographic soundstage
  * Smooth, musical tonality
  * High efficiency (easy to drive)
  * User tuning possibilities through ear pad swapping
* **Negative / Subjective Elements:**
  * Lacks ultimate micro-detail reproduction compared to top-tier competitors
  * Bass is controlled but lacks gut-impacting slam
  * Some users may find the tuning too "safe"
  * Premium pricing

## **Chapter Five: View from the Summit — Comprehensive Analysis**

Analyzing Elite's position in the high-end market—so-called "Summit-Fi"—is essential for understanding its raison d'être.

Today's Summit-Fi market has become a battlefield of specialists. The [HIFIMAN Susvara](/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled) achieves ultimate transparency in exchange for demanding tremendous driving power [19](#ref-19). The coldly analytical [Audeze LCD-5](/reviews/audeze-lcd5) exposes everything in the source material [21](#ref-21). The [Focal Utopia](/reviews/focal-utopia-sg) delivers shocking punch unique to dynamic drivers [21](#ref-21). All are solitary specialists who sacrificed something to perfect something else.

Elite chose none of these paths. This was not an escape from competition but a clear strategic choice. Elite is surprisingly easy to drive [10](#ref-10), comfortable enough to wear for hours [11](#ref-11), and delivers universally pleasant sound that never breaks down regardless of genre [13](#ref-13). This signifies liberation from the "ascetic practices" that traditional high-end audio imposed on users—complex system building and devotion to specific musical genres.

Elite's raison d'être lies in being "the most user-friendly, most comfortable, and most comprehensively luxurious flagship." Its value is defined by the sum total of all user experiences, from the moment of unboxing to the hundredth listening session. What might appear as a weakness—"not being the most technically cutting-edge"—is inextricably linked to its greatest strength—"providing the most comfortable musical immersion."

* **vs. [HIFIMAN Susvara](/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled):** Choice between ultimate transparency and effortless musicality. If Susvara is an electron microscope, Elite is a stained glass window.
* **vs. [Audeze LCD-5](/reviews/audeze-lcd5):** Truly "Summit-Fi's yin and yang" [21](#ref-21). If LCD-5 appeals to intellect (analysis, detail), Elite speaks to the soul (emotion, immersion).
* **vs. [Dan Clark Audio Expanse](/reviews/danclarkaudio-expanse):** Two masters of comfort and tuning. Against Expanse's more intimate and technically precise presentation, Elite offers a more grand, forgiving, and slightly warmer soundscape [23](#ref-23).

## **Chapter Six: Conclusion — Who Should Listen to This Sound**

The Meze Audio Elite is not headphones for everyone. However, for listeners with specific values, it becomes an irreplaceable, singular existence.

### **Users I Would Recommend These Headphones To**

* **Comprehensive Audiophiles:** Those who value comfort, build quality, and design aesthetics as much as sound quality.
* **Extended Listening Enthusiasts:** Those who prioritize immersing in music for long periods without fatigue over analytical listening.
* **Simplicity Advocates:** Those who want to own just one versatile flagship that delivers excellent performance across wide ranges of equipment and music without demanding specific high-power amplifiers.

### **Users Who Should Avoid These Headphones**

* **Detail Supremacists:** Those whose supreme joy lies in extracting every last fragment of micro-detail from recordings ([Susvara](/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled) or [LCD-5](/reviews/audeze-lcd5) would be more suitable).
* **Dynamics Pursuers:** Those craving gut-shaking bass slam and aggressive impact ([Abyss AB-1266](/reviews/abyss-ab1266-phi-tc) or [Focal Utopia](/reviews/focal-utopia-sg) would provide greater satisfaction).
* **Cost-Performance Focused Audiophiles:** Those for whom performance improvement per dollar invested is the primary metric.

The Meze Audio Elite steps down from the game of competing on spec sheet numbers and questions the quality of the listening experience itself. It is a complete worldview born from the happy encounter between art and engineering. For all contemplative listeners who know that the act of listening to sound can sometimes become intellectual exploration and sometimes spiritual solace, dialogue with Elite will undoubtedly bring immeasurable richness.
