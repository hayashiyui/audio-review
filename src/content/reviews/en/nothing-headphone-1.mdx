Once again, they've done it. I'm talking about London's maverick, Nothing. Having refreshingly shattered the "boring" smartphone market with transparent design and flashy Glyph Interface[1](#ref-1), they've now crashed into the over-ear headphone market. The name? A bold "Headphone (1)".

The reason the audio community buzzed the moment this unit was announced is crystal clear. One is the uniquely retro-futuristic design that has become Nothing's calling card. The other is the "Sound by KEF" credit[3](#ref-3) from teaming up with British Hi-Fi legend KEF. At under \$300, bringing high-end prestige and pedigree to silence even audiophiles—it would be impossible not to have expectations.

However, interestingly, the evaluation is split right down the middle between "heaven and hell." While everyone praises the design and build quality, the crucial sound—especially the "stock sound"—has been burning with criticism that "this is terrible."

So is Nothing Headphone (1) a fashion item that's all show? Or is it an unfinished masterpiece that reveals its true value when polished by its user? Here, I want to expose the true identity of this cunning maverick using both the subjectivity of "ears" and the objectivity of "data."

## **Nothing Headphone (1) — Overview**

* **Manufacturer / Model:** Nothing / Headphone (1)
* **Release Date:** July 15, 2025 (Global) [3](#ref-3)
* **Price Range:** \$299 / £299 / €299 [3](#ref-3)

**Key Specifications:**

* **Driver:** 40 mm dynamic driver [6](#ref-6)
* **Impedance:** 16 Ω [6](#ref-6)
* **Frequency Response:** 20 Hz - 40,000 Hz (Hi-Res Audio certified) [6](#ref-6)
* **Bluetooth Version:** 5.3 [6](#ref-6)
* **Supported Codecs:** AAC, SBC, LDAC [4](#ref-4)
* **Battery Life:** Up to 80 hours (ANC off), Up to 35 hours (ANC on) [4](#ref-4)

This spec sheet is quite interesting. LDAC support, Hi-Res certification, and monster-like battery life. These are specs normally seen in price tiers a notch higher. This "spec contradiction" poses us one question: "Where exactly did Nothing balance the books?" That answer is the core of this review.

## **1. Public Opinion: The Eye of the Storm of Polarized Reviews**

Once Headphone (1) was released to the market, the review community became a storm of mixed opinions. But what's interesting is that the evaluations are cleanly polarized.

| Media | Quote (English) | Rating |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/nothing-headphone-1-review-an-eye-catching-design-backed-by-strong-performance/) | "An eye-catching design backed by strong performance... Sound quality is good but not a wow." | 8.2/10 |
| [Mark Ellis Reviews](https://markellisreviews.com/reviews/nothing-headphone-1-review-a-brave-move/) | "The wacky design is backed up by great sound quality... Whether you actually buy them rests on your reaction to that striking design." | 90% |
| [PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/nothing-headphone-1) | "Getting the best audio requires tinkering. Fit could be more comfortable." | ★★★☆☆ (3.5) |
| [SoundGuys](https://www.soundguys.com/nothing-headphone-1-vs-apple-airpods-max-141109/) | "Default sound is dark. Doesn't fold." | 7.1/10 |
| [What Hi-Fi?](https://www.whathifi.com/headphones/wireless-headphones/nothing-headphone-1) | "Good impression of a balanced, authoritative sound, with solid detail levels... Design won't be for everyone." | ★★★★☆ |
| [Reddit (r/NothingTech)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech/comments/1mmqgjt/nothing_headphone1_a_disaster_out_of_the_box_but/) | "a disaster out of the box, but.. can be one of the best wireless headphones available right now." | N/A |

As you can see, the evaluation pattern is surprisingly consistent. The **praised points** are almost without exception these three:

1. **Unique Design:** A look that absolutely cannot be obtained elsewhere, stimulating ownership desire[4](#ref-4).

2. **Build Quality Beyond Its Price:** Effective use of aluminum with extreme premium feel[9](#ref-9).

3. **Divine Physical Controls:** Free from touch operation frustrations. Intuitive and reliable operability[8](#ref-8).

On the other hand, the **criticized points** focus on essentially one thing:

1. **Out-of-Box Sound Quality:** Trashed with words like "dark," "muddy," "compressed," and "dead"[12](#ref-12).

The key here is that many reviews add "however." The key player in this turnaround is the powerful parametric equalizer (EQ) sitting in the Nothing X app. Reviewers unanimously conclude "if you tweak the EQ, it transforms"[10](#ref-10).

In other words, this is the situation: This product's value isn't innate but is "conditionally" unlocked. This is the complete opposite of Apple and Bose's philosophy of perfection straight out of the box. Headphone (1) is a truly provocative product that challenges users to "unlock this guy's potential yourself."

## **2. The Philosophy of "Nothing" Design and KEF Heritage: The Maverick's Origins**

To understand this headphone's peculiarity, we need to shine light from the philosophies of two brands: Nothing, the creator, and KEF, the sound supervisor.

### **Nothing's Philosophy: Counter to the Boring Market**

Nothing founder Carl Pei is the former OnePlus co-founder. His philosophy is consistent: "Make technology exciting again" and "remove barriers between people and technology"[18](#ref-18). Their approach is to smash powerful design counters into commoditized, stagnant markets. The transparent design that stunned with Ear (1) is the crystallization of that philosophy[1](#ref-1).

Headphone (1) strongly inherits that DNA. Cassette tape-like square earcups, see-through design with visible internals, and best of all, stubbornly sticking with physical controls in an era when touch operation is standard[8](#ref-8). The volume adjustment "roller," track skip "paddle," and function assignment "buttons." These liberate users from ambiguous gestures and provide definite tactile feedback with clicks and cranks. This is nothing other than the embodiment of the philosophy to "remove barriers between people and technology."

<Picture src={controlsImage} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="Close-up of Nothing Headphone (1) physical controls showing button layout and USB-C port on earcup" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />

### **KEF Collaboration: What's the Real Intent?**

The other pillar is the "Sound by KEF" sign. KEF is the legendary British speaker brand known for the LS50 series. For a young tech company like Nothing to gain trust from audio enthusiasts, there's no better "seal of approval"[11](#ref-11).

According to official sources, KEF was involved in tuning the custom 40mm driver, aiming for "natural and accurate sound" and "powerful, distortion-free bass"[6](#ref-6). The driver itself appears to have specialized design[6](#ref-6).

But here's a question: Did KEF really give the go-ahead to that heavily criticized out-of-box sound? It's hard to imagine logically. Rather, isn't it more natural to speculate this way: KEF's job was only to prepare a high-potential driver—the best "canvas." Nothing deliberately applied DSP tuning "paint" thinly or left it "unfinished" on that canvas before shipping. By doing so, they tried to make users experience the importance of their powerful parametric EQ and appeal that this is the product's core attraction. In other words, the "Sound by KEF" logo should be understood not as a guarantee of finished sound, but as a seal guaranteeing "hardware performance capable of extensive tweaking."

### **Competitive Spec Comparison Table**

Let's compare with objective data to see where this guy stands in the market.

| Item | Nothing Headphone (1) | [Sony WH-1000XM6](/en/reviews/sony-wh1000xm6) | [Bose QuietComfort Ultra](/en/reviews/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones) | [Apple AirPods Max](/en/reviews/apple-airpods-max) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Weight** | 329 g [4](#ref-4) | Approx. 254 g [22](#ref-22) | Approx. 254 g [24](#ref-24) | 384.8 g [26](#ref-26) |
| **Driver** | 40 mm | 30 mm [28](#ref-28) | N/A | 40 mm [29](#ref-29) |
| **Supported Codecs** | SBC, AAC, **LDAC** [4](#ref-4) | SBC, AAC, **LDAC**, LC3 [22](#ref-22) | SBC, AAC, aptX Adaptive [30](#ref-30) | SBC, AAC |
| **Battery (ANC On)** | **35 hours** [4](#ref-4) | 30 hours [28](#ref-28) | 24 hours [31](#ref-31) | 20 hours [29](#ref-29) |
| **Foldable** | No [8](#ref-8) | Yes [28](#ref-28) | Yes [32](#ref-32) | No |
| **Price (MSRP)** | **\$299** [7](#ref-7) | \$449.99 [33](#ref-33) | \$429 [31](#ref-31) | \$549 [34](#ref-34) |

This table eloquently tells Headphone (1)'s strategy. While giving ground to Sony and Bose in weight, it takes advantage with battery, and above all, overwhelms rivals with price. It's clear they're avoiding a direct brawl and challenging in a different ring: design, customizability, and cost-performance.

## **3. Measurement Data Exposes the "True Face": Diamond in the Rough or Just a Rock?**

Are the reviewers' subjective cries backed up by cold measurement data? Measurement data from specialist site SoundGuys exposes the "true face" of this headphone's acoustic characteristics[47](#ref-47).

* **Sound Quality (MDAQS Rating):** Scored 4.1 out of 5 on SoundGuys' sound quality evaluation score (MDAQS). This is in the "good" category, showing a level most people will be satisfied with. What's interesting is the breakdown: "Timbre" representing sound naturalness scores high at 4.4, while "Distortion" drags it down at 3.5. No problem if not listening at high volumes, but hardware limits might be showing here[47](#ref-47).
* **Frequency Response:** As expected. The default sound's "darkness" is measurement-proven. Bass follows the target, but midrange (200Hz-500Hz) and treble (above 2kHz) drop sharply[30](#ref-30). This scientifically matches the "ear" impression of recessed vocals and lost cymbal brilliance. Claim → Evidence → Conclusion. The syllogism is complete.

<ImageWithCitation imagePath={measurementFR1} sourceTitle="Fig. Nothing Headphone (1) Frequency Response - SoundGuys" sourceUrl="https://www.soundguys.com/nothing-headphone-1-review-something-different-140323/" />

* **Noise Cancelling Performance:** ANC performance is very good. Measurements show average 85% noise cut across frequency bands. Particularly strong against low-frequency train rumble noise, attenuating 15-25dB. This is proof of tremendous effectiveness for commuting and offices. However, a weakness against wind noise is also pointed out[47](#ref-47). Considering the price, it's excellent, but yields a step to Bose and Sony.

<ImageWithCitation imagePath={measurementNC1} sourceTitle="Fig. Nothing Headphone (1) Noise Attenuation Chart - SoundGuys" sourceUrl="https://www.soundguys.com/nothing-headphone-1-review-something-different-140323/" />

* **Microphone Performance:** Thanks to microphone and AI noise suppression technology, call quality is clear in quiet places. However, performance drops severely in reverberant rooms, tending to make voices sound distant[47](#ref-47). Heavy remote meeting users should be cautious.

What this data shows is the gap where hardware has good fundamentals but default tuning doesn't fully utilize them (or intentionally doesn't). Truly a "rough diamond." It's up to users whether to polish it or leave it as is.

## **4. Jekyll and Hyde in Listening: EQ Divides Sound Between Life and Death**

So how does it actually sound when playing music? This one truly has two extreme faces, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

### **Default Sound: "Mr. Hyde's" Tyranny**

The Headphone (1) sound out of the box without touching EQ honestly disappoints expectations. As many reviews say, it's like wearing a thick blanket over your head.

* One Reddit user trashes it as "disaster level out of the box" and "like \$10 fake headphones"[10](#ref-10).
* Another user is harsh: "sounds like cheap 25 euro airport stuff"[15](#ref-15).
* PCMag's review says orchestral sources have "treble, brass, and vocals competing for space, everything mixed and lacking excitement"[35](#ref-35).

Muddy bass, recessed mids, unexpanded treble. This is "Mr. Hyde's" face that everyone first encounters. You wonder what KEF's logo was all about.

### **EQ Transformation: "Dr. Jekyll's" Awakening**

But the story starts here. The moment you open the Nothing X app and touch the Advanced EQ, Headphone (1) reveals its true form.

This EQ is different from some bonus feature. It's a **full 8-band parametric EQ**[36](#ref-36), a cut above the graphic EQs competitors offer. Each band allows detailed adjustment of center frequency and Q value (range width), letting you sculpt sound like a studio engineer. Surgical operations like "pinpoint suppressing only harsh treble sibilance" are child's play[37](#ref-37).

What's even more interesting is the community feature. You can share custom EQ presets via QR code and try others' settings with one scan[36](#ref-36). This creates an ecosystem where even without EQ knowledge, you can easily install the best settings created by experts and enthusiasts like "SoundGuys recommended EQ"[17](#ref-17).

### **Post-EQ Genre Impressions**

Wielding this magic wand (EQ) dramatically changes the sound.

* **EDM / Hip-Hop:** The combination of EQ and "Bass Enhance" function transforms the sluggish bass into powerful, well-defined bass. Deep, distortion-free low end is quality that satisfies bass lovers[11](#ref-11).
* **Rock / Pop:** Stripping the mid-high blanket with EQ brings vocals forward. Buried guitar riffs and cymbal sparkle revive, giving the whole track dynamism[10](#ref-10).
* **Jazz / Classical:** While the soundstage isn't originally wide, organizing each instrument's frequency bands with EQ improves separation and depth. Delicate nuances like piano touch and string texture become audible, greatly increasing immersion[35](#ref-35).

This transformation is proof that Nothing is trying to redefine "premium audio experience." Traditional premium products were like museums where you appreciate finished works created by manufacturers. In contrast, Headphone (1) hands users high-performance instruments and scores (EQ), challenging: "Now, play your own best music." From passive consumption to active creation. This is a truly bold attempt.

## **5. Overall Rating: Scoreboard of Light and Shadow**

Based on the analysis so far, let's evaluate each category. This scoreboard reflects both the intense light and deep shadows of this product.

| Evaluation Axis | Score (out of 5) | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | ★★★★☆ (4.0) | Hardware fundamentals are extremely good[6](#ref-6). ANC performance with average 85% noise attenuation is sufficiently strong considering the price[47](#ref-47). The app with professional parametric EQ is also impressive[35](#ref-35). However, measurement-exposed distortion levels[47](#ref-47) and indefensible out-of-box sound quality drag it down, preventing a perfect score. |
| **Musical Appeal** | ★★★☆☆ (3.5) | ★1 out of box, transforms to ★5 after EQ—extreme dual nature. Therefore, only a middle rating is possible. This score is "conditionally" dependent on "willingness to adjust." |
| **Build Quality** | ★★★★☆ (4.5) | Unique design, aluminum premium feel, and unmatched physical control operability. Outstanding in this price range[8](#ref-8). Deducting 0.5 points for not folding and large case[4](#ref-4). |
| **Price-to-Value** | ★★★★☆ (4.5) | Getting this design, features, build, and "potential" sound quality at \$299 is a bargain[4](#ref-4). For users it clicks with, it offers unbeatable value. Truly a lump of relative value. |
| **Future-Proofing / Repairability** | ★★★☆☆ (3.0) | App updates and USB-C audio support are good. However, unclear earpad replaceability[8](#ref-8) is a fatal concern for long-term use. The unique design likely makes repairs difficult too. |

As this evaluation shows, Headphone (1) isn't a well-balanced honor student. Not "can do everything" but "what it can do is best, what it can't do is worst." User satisfaction is completely proportional to whether they're willing to face this one head-on.

## **6. Market Position: Trickster of the \$300 Headphone Warring States Era**

In conclusion, what is Nothing Headphone (1)'s existence in today's wireless headphone market?

It's a "trickster" that destroys existing rules and bamboozles giants. While Sony, Bose, and Apple compete on the royal road of "best ANC" and "perfect sound quality," Nothing brought a completely different arena. That's the trinity of **design, operability, and sound "customizability"**[21](#ref-21).

This product doesn't pander to everyone. The target is clear: tech-savvy, design-conscious people seeking something uniquely their own. It deeply resonates with users who value self-expression—those who love custom PCs and keyboards, who tweak Android home screens endlessly.

Nothing's approach might actually be a litmus test for consumer technology's future. Industry trends are toward stripping users of choices, heading for refined "just works" simple experiences. Nothing's philosophy is the exact opposite. They give users powerful tools (EQ) and believe users have the intelligence and motivation to master them.

Headphone (1)'s success suggests that the "prosumer" market valuing "user autonomy" over "simplicity" may grow significantly going forward. Nothing isn't just selling headphones. They're selling a "philosophy" that technology should be more interesting and more personal.

## **7. Conclusion & Recommended Users**

This headphone is for people who see sound not as a finished product to passively receive, but as a canvas to actively create upon.
Its essence is a provocative audio experience that tests users with a "raw gem" of excellent hardware and the strongest tool (EQ) to polish it.

* **Recommended For**
  * First and foremost, people who want to satisfy design and ownership desire[44](#ref-44).
  * Audio "tinkerers" who want to thoroughly customize sound to their preference[10](#ref-10).
  * People fed up with touch controls who love reliable physical button operability[8](#ref-8).
* **Not Recommended For**
  * Plug-and-play purists demanding the best sound straight out of the box[15](#ref-15).
  * People who absolutely require market-leading noise cancellation performance[4](#ref-4).
  * People with large heads or extremely sensitive to fit (trying them on is absolutely essential)[9](#ref-9).

Finally, if I were to give this one a nickname:

**"The Modular Synth of Headphone Audio"**

### **Overall Rating (★×5)**

★★★☆☆ (3.5)
