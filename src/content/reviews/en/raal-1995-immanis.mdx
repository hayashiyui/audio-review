The act of music reproduction, when distilled to its essence, is an attempt to faithfully and beautifully extract the chaos called art from within ordered signals. We audiophiles continue our endless exploration with the scalpel called technology, addressing this paradoxical proposition. And in 2024, from a Serbian workshop emerged a formidable headphone that would cast a new stone into the history of this exploration. The RAAL 1995 Immanis. Its name means "immense" or "vast" in Latin. In this article, I aim to delve into the core of what landscape this new giant will paint upon the horizon of headphone audio.

## **1. Media Review Aggregation**

The arrival of the Immanis delivered a quiet yet definitive shock to the high-end audio world. To get a comprehensive view of its reception, I've aggregated major reviews below. However, we must remember that reviews always contain inherent biases from the reviewer's background and listening environment.

| Media | Quote Excerpt | Rating | Bias Assessment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Headfonia](https://www.headfonia.com/raal-1995-immanis-review/3/)  | "The RAAL 1995 Immanis, with its Ribbon technology, is a unique headphone with a sound signature that is just as special... If you like a high-end sound where you get a superbly strong technical performance but with a musical and energetic delivery, the Immanis is the perfect headphone for you." | ★★★★★ (Recommended Buy Award) | **Neutral to Positive Bias:** Review sample provided by manufacturer. Detailed analysis from an experienced reviewer, though good relationship with brand is evident. Evaluation is reliable, but enthusiastic expressions warrant caution. |
| [Z Reviews (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWFWV94MD5g)  | "This is probably one of the best headphones one can buy... To me Susvara has never moved me enough to purchase it... But the Immanis is different... To me it's the sound perfection I've been looking for." | ★★★★★ (New Headphone King) | **Strong Positive Bias:** Loaner from dealer. Reviewer owns Abyss 1266 and has stated lack of appeal for Susvara, showing clear personal preferences. The praise for Immanis in this context may be influenced by bias against comparison models. |
| [The HEADPHONE Show (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anTb5JlunuA)  | "this is one of the biggest staging headphones I have ever heard... so if you like intimate sounding music and you want it to sound intimate, one possible downside here is that this one never really sounds instrument intimate it always sounds big and grand." | ★★★★☆ (Qualified Praise) | **Analytical & Neutral:** Loaner from friend. Technically knowledgeable, pointing out both strengths and weaknesses objectively. Notably highlights that the "always grand" characteristic—often praised by others—could be a drawback for certain users, adding credibility. |
| [StereoNET Forum User "BlueOceanBoy"](https://www.stereonet.com/forums/topic/615811-raal-1995-immanis-ribbon-headphones-%E2%80%93-early-impressions/) | "Immanis presents a vivid, slightly warm of neutral, excellent tonal quality across all genres... Bass is thunderous, addictive but well controlled with no bleed into the mids." | ★★★★★ (Enthusiast Praise) | **Owner Bias:** Early review from personal purchaser. Very high enthusiasm with emphasis on positive aspects (confirmation bias). However, comparison based on ownership of multiple flagships including Susvara and 1266 TC provides valuable real-world perspective. |
| [Headphones.com Forum User "MrSehrKalt"](https://forum.headphones.com/t/raal-1995-immanis/23669) | "There were prominent peaks in the treble and it just sounded too bright for me overall... Unfortunately I couldn't hear the bass goodness and the tremendous soundstage described in your review." | ★★☆☆☆ (Negative Impression) | **Situational Bias:** Brief audition at audio show. Noisy environment with unknown amp pairing. Treble sharpness observation aligns with other opinions and is noteworthy, but poor listening conditions likely significantly degraded the evaluation. |

Aggregation and Insights:
After surveying approximately 10 sources including Headfonia, Z Reviews, Bloom Audio, 6moons, StereoNET, and Head-Fi, positive evaluations represent an overwhelming majority (about 85%). The expansive soundstage, high resolution, and dynamic expression are praised almost universally across reviews [4](#ref-4).

However, an interesting dichotomy emerges. Professional reviews with manufacturer loans in ideal environments tend to praise the Immanis as a new benchmark [8](#ref-8). Meanwhile, auditions in uncontrolled environments like audio shows, or from users with specific treble sensitivity, note it as "too bright" or "peaky" [11](#ref-11).

This suggests the Immanis isn't a "safe for everyone" tuning. Its ultimate sound presentation heavily depends on the upstream system (DAC, amp) and listener sensibility. The Immanis's transparency is a double-edged sword—it reveals the beauty of a perfectly harmonized system while mercilessly exposing even minor upstream flaws. The debate about treble isn't questioning the headphone itself, but rather reflects the mirror it holds to diverse systems and listener sensibilities.

## **2. Design Philosophy and Technical Singularity**

To understand the Immanis, we must trace its lineage—the journey of the RAAL brand.

### **RAAL's Heritage: From Heretic to Orthodox**

RAAL, founded by Serbian engineer Aleksandar Radisavljevic, originally made its name as a manufacturer of world-class ribbon tweeters for speakers [12](#ref-12). Their first headphone application of this technology, the SR1a "Earfield™ Monitor," appeared in the audio world with an "open baffle" structure that fundamentally overturned headphone conventions—positioning drivers away from the ears without sealing them, like speakers [13](#ref-13). This was a radical attempt to achieve speaker-like expansive soundstage, but remained a niche existence for select pioneering enthusiasts due to unavoidable bass deficiency from the structure and the difficulty of driving requiring powerful speaker amplifiers [8](#ref-8).

The Immanis's arrival should be viewed as a strategic turning point in this context. If the SR1a was a concept model proving ribbon technology's "possibilities," the Immanis was created to "tame" that revolutionary but wild technology and compete head-to-head on the same battlefield with existing kings like the [HIFIMAN Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/) and [Abyss AB-1266 TC](/en/reviews/abyss-ab1266-phi-tc/) [2](#ref-2). It represents nothing less than a return from heretical experimentation to the mainstream pursuit of the throne.

### **R³ Triple-Driver: The Trinity Heart**

The core of the Immanis lies in its deployment of three true ribbon drivers per side, totaling six drivers [1](#ref-1). This is a significant evolution from the single-driver SR1a and dual-driver sibling Magna.

The purpose of multiple ribbons extends beyond mere SPL improvement. Based on a philosophy called "Complementary Tuning," each ribbon's characteristics are intentionally tuned slightly differently to cancel out inherent distortions and resonances unavoidable in single diaphragms, aiming for more perfect overall operation [2](#ref-2).

The physical characteristics are overwhelming. Since the ribbon—extremely lightweight aluminum foil itself—is driven directly by current, the moving mass approaches zero, achieving miraculous transient response (speed) and resolution comparable to electrostatics [2](#ref-2). Additionally, the extensive +/- 4mm excursion enables deep, powerful bass reproduction that traditional true ribbons struggled with [1](#ref-1).

### **RCDI: Current Drive Converter**

An unavoidable aspect of discussing the Immanis is its unique drive method. With impedance of just 0.057Ω, it's electrically almost a short circuit [1](#ref-1). Connecting this directly to a normal amplifier risks fatal damage to both amp and headphone [3](#ref-3).

Therefore, using the included RCDI (Ribbon Current-Drive Interface) is absolutely essential. This box contains high-quality toroidal transformers that convert typical "voltage drive" signals from amplifiers into high-current "current drive" signals suitable for ribbons. It simultaneously presents a stable 32Ω load to the amplifier [1](#ref-1).

The RCDI's existence means the Immanis isn't just a "headphone" but a "system" requiring dedicated drive components. This resembles how electrostatic headphones require dedicated energizers. This fact contains important implications: the quality of all cables—from amp to RCDI, and RCDI to headphone—becomes as important as the amplifier itself. Driving the Immanis is a challenging yet attractive endeavor that questions the completeness of the entire audio chain.

| Model | Type | Nominal Specs | Drive / System | Price Range (USD) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **RAAL 1995 Immanis** | True Ribbon | 0.057Ω (unit), 118dB Max SPL | **Required:** High-output HPA/speaker amp via RCDI (2-6W@32Ω recommended) | ~\$9,460 (Full Pkg) |
| **[HIFIMAN Susvara Unveiled](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/)** | Planar Magnetic | 45Ω / 86dB | **Needs:** High-output, high-quality headphone amp | ~\$8,000 |
| **[Abyss AB-1266 Phi TC](/en/reviews/abyss-ab1266-phi-tc/)** | Planar Magnetic | 50Ω / 88dB | **Needs:** Speaker amp-level driving power | ~\$5,995 |
| **[Audeze LCD-5](/en/reviews/audeze-lcd5/)** | Planar Magnetic | 14Ω / 90dB | Relatively easy but sensitive to upstream quality | ~\$4,500 |
| **[Focal Utopia (2022)](/en/reviews/focal-utopia-sg/)** | Dynamic | 80Ω / 104dB | Relatively easy (high efficiency) | ~\$4,999 |
| **[STAX SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000/)** | Electrostatic | 145kΩ / 100dB | **Required:** Dedicated electrostatic amp (Energizer) | ~\$6,200 (unit only) |

## **3. Objective Analysis Based on Measurement Data**

While detailed measurement graphs aren't published by the manufacturer, third-party measurement data provides valuable clues for objectively understanding the Immanis's acoustic characteristics.

### **Frequency Response**

Measurements by Accurate Sound report the Immanis's frequency response as overall "bright with some unevenness." This appears to be the result of intentional tuning, with characteristics as follows [35](#ref-35).

<ImageWithCitation
  imagePath={mesurementGraph1}
  sourceTitle="Frequency Response Measurement & Correction - ACCURATE SOUND"
  sourceUrl="https://accuratesound.ca/product/raal-1995-immanis-filterset/"
/>

* **Bass:** A gentle rise of about 2dB below 80Hz, contributing to perceived power and quantity.
* **Midrange:** Small peaks at 150Hz and 300Hz, with broader elevation from 400Hz to 1.5kHz. Meanwhile, a clear dip exists from 1.5kHz to 2.5kHz. This pre-upper-midrange dip possibly represents intentional tuning to create soundstage width and depth [36](#ref-36).
* **Treble:** The most prominent feature is a +6dB peak between 3kHz and 6kHz [35](#ref-35). This band where human hearing is most sensitive determines the Immanis's "vivid" and "forward" sound signature [35](#ref-35). This peak can also cause some listeners or environments to perceive it as "too bright" or "piercing" [11](#ref-11).

<ImageWithCitation
  imagePath={mesurementGraph2}
  sourceTitle="a measurement of the RAAL Immanis on my clone 43AG (KB006x clone + clone 711 coupler), displayed against the DF HRTF of the fixture with Harman 2018 filters on it. - Headphones.com"
  sourceUrl="https://forum.headphones.com/t/raal-1995-immanis/23669/3"
/>

Overall, the Immanis's frequency response differs from flat monitor sound. This seemingly "unbalanced" characteristic likely results from calculated acoustic design to achieve both expansive soundstage and exceptional detail [35](#ref-35).

### **Distortion and Transient Response**

* **Distortion (THD):** While THD measurement data for the Immanis unit itself is scarce, the RCDI (interface) at the system's core reports extremely low distortion at -100dB [19](#ref-19). Given the ribbon driver's extremely low mass and high tracking ability, driver distortion is presumably kept at very low levels. This aligns with the transparency and high resolution praised in many reviews.
* **Transient Response (Impulse Response):** While measurement graphs aren't available, the ribbon driver's physical characteristics suggest extremely fast impulse response. As many reviews express with phrases like "lightning speed" and "phenomenal transient performance" [2](#ref-2), the speed of attack and decay is one of the Immanis's greatest weapons, undoubtedly contributing to clarity without congestion in complex passages and reproduction of subtle nuances.

## **4. Sonic Exploration**

Technical specifications alone cannot touch the soul of reproduced music. From here, let's delve deeply into the sonic world the Immanis weaves.

### **Fragments of Quoted Impressions**

First, I'd like to outline the acoustic portrait by arranging fragments of impressions the Immanis has given listeners worldwide.

| Reviewer / Media | Quote Excerpt |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Bloom Audio](https://bloomaudio.com/products/raal-1995-immanis) | "it pairs ethereal electrostatic-like detail with the visceral weight of planar bass... And the soundstage doesn't just sprawl — it breathes." |
| [StereoNET Forum User "BlueOceanBoy"](https://www.stereonet.com/forums/topic/615811-raal-1995-immanis-ribbon-headphones-%E2%80%93-early-impressions/) | "Separation and sense of space – More like 2Ch than SR1-a! There's an encompassing dense spatial sound image that is holographic." |
| [Head-Case.org Forum User "deepthought"](https://www.head-case.org/forums/topic/33676-raal-1995-immanis/) | "I was willing to give up bass extension in the SR-1a and, to a lesser extent, the CA-1a, but here there is no need for a trade. They are every bit as detailed and incisive as their siblings but with very present bass extension." |

### **Genre-Based Sound Quality Analysis**

Classical (Mahler Symphony No. 2 "Resurrection"):
What's tested here is the reproduction of grand scale and dynamic range. The Immanis's soundstage isn't merely wide left-to-right. It perfectly renders a vast three-dimensional space with front-to-back, left-to-right, and even height perception [4](#ref-4). From the opening roar of cellos and double basses to the climax where organ and chorus unite in the finale, from timpani strikes to delicate string textures in pianissimo passages, every sound separates without congestion, conveying life-like breathing of the entire orchestra. This must be the benefit of the ribbon's overwhelming speed and control. It's like an experience fusing the tonal beauty of the [HIFIMAN Susvara Unveiled](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled/), the physical impact of the [Abyss AB-1266 TC](/en/reviews/abyss-ab1266-phi-tc/), and the spatial transparency of the [STAX SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000/) [8](#ref-8).

Jazz (Bill Evans Trio "Waltz for Debby"):
The Village Vanguard's atmosphere, audience coughs, and clinking glasses—the subtle information surrounding the music is tested. The Immanis, with resolution rivaling electrostatics, vividly depicts Paul Motian's cymbal legato reverb dissolving into space and Scott LaFaro's wood bass body resonance [8](#ref-8). However, as The HEADPHONE Show reviewer aptly noted, the overly vast soundstage might make what should be an intimate jazz club feel somewhat like a larger concert hall [31](#ref-31). This represents a different approach to realism than the [Focal Utopia](/en/reviews/focal-utopia-sg/)'s raw "presence" of vocals and instruments performing right before you.

Rock / Electronic (Opeth "Blackwater Park" / Daft Punk "Random Access Memories"):
What's questioned here is bass quantity, speed, and transient performance. As many reviews attest, the Immanis's bass completely overcomes the SR1a's former weakness [5](#ref-5). It's not just plentiful but extremely tight, with phenomenally fast attack and decay. While delivering the physical impact many reviewers call planar "slam" [8](#ref-8), it never masks the midrange. The way Opeth's complex guitar riffs and rapid drum fills separate without any congestion is simply stunning. This differs from the [Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/)'s rich, mellow bass—it's more taut, controlled, athletic bass [8](#ref-8).

## **5. Overall Evaluation and Bias Check**

Evaluating the Immanis from every angle to fairly depict its light and shadow.

| Evaluation Axis | Score (out of 5) | Commentary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | **5.0** | Resolution, speed, dynamics, soundstage, lack of distortion across all frequencies. Positioned at the highest achievable point for current headphones across all technical metrics. Spatial reproduction capability is particularly unparalleled [8](#ref-8). |
| **Musical Appeal** | **4.5** | The musical experience from overwhelming performance is intense. Neutral-based tuning with slight warmth and powerful bass enhances musical immersion [19](#ref-19). However, its overly grand expression might reduce "intimacy" in some tracks, preventing a perfect score [31](#ref-31). |
| **Build Quality** | **4.5** | Uncompromising use of premium materials: American walnut, gold-plated stainless steel, genuine leather. Extremely high construction precision [1](#ref-1). However, the 626g weight cannot be ignored, with individual variation in long-term comfort [1](#ref-1). The headband adjustment mechanism is robust but lacks Abyss-like flexibility. |
| **Price-to-Value** | **2.5** | The ~\$10,000 price may be justified for those pursuing absolute performance, but from an objective cost-performance perspective, it's extremely low. Competitors like [Susvara Unveiled](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled/) and [Utopia](/en/reviews/focal-utopia-sg/) offer extremely high satisfaction at less than half the price. Furthermore, equivalent-class amplification is essential for maximum performance, making total system cost astronomical [5](#ref-5). |
| **Future-Proofing / Serviceability** | **4.0** | The 5-year transferable warranty is generous [1](#ref-1). Component replacement like headbands appears considered [12](#ref-12). However, the proprietary RCDI and ribbon driver specificity leaves some concern about long-term support and parts availability. |

## **6. The Immanis's Position in Audio Philosophy**

The Immanis isn't merely a high-performance headphone. It's an entity that poses fundamental questions about the nature of high-end audio itself.

### **A Solution to Headphones' "Three-Body Problem"**

The high-end headphone world has long been dominated by three currents, each with its own peak: electrostatic "speed and transparency," planar magnetic "power and texture," and dynamic "natural tonality and dynamism." Listeners have been forced to make painful choices about which virtues to prioritize.

The Immanis might overturn this premise. The fact that many reviewers use paradoxical language to describe its sound is suggestive. "Pairing ethereal electrostatic-like detail with the visceral weight of planar bass" [4](#ref-4). Evaluations comparing it to [STAX SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000/) speed and transparency, [Abyss AB-1266 TC](/en/reviews/abyss-ab1266-phi-tc/)-reminiscent bass authority, and [HIFIMAN Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/)-like tonal naturalness coexisting in one chassis are countless [19](#ref-19).

This suggests the Immanis isn't just an excellent product within the ribbon category, but an ambitious attempt to "integrate" the most desirable characteristics of major drive methods. It's like declaring audiophiles no longer need to choose their "preferred flavor." That a single transducer can embody all virtues at the highest level. The philosophical significance of the Immanis lies not in aiming to be the best ribbon headphone, but in aiming to be the ultimate headphone itself.

### **The Price of Transparency**

Another aspect of the Immanis is its thorough "transparency." It mercilessly reveals upstream equipment character, recording quality, even differences in single power cables. While a virtue, this means constant challenge for users. Unless the entire system can withstand the Immanis's "microscope," not only will its true value not manifest, but flaws will be magnified [31](#ref-31). Owning the Immanis might be synonymous with choosing the endless path of audio exploration.

## **7. Conclusion & Recommended Users**

### **Recommended For**

* **Absolute Performance Seekers:** Audiophiles who want to experience the highest technical performance currently possible, regardless of price or system complexity.
* **Listeners Who Prefer Vast Soundstage:** Those wanting to achieve speaker-like, out-of-head, vast holographic soundstage with headphones.
* **Owners of Powerful Amplifiers:** Users with already-built amp systems capable of easily driving [HIFIMAN Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara/) or [Abyss AB-1266 TC](/en/reviews/abyss-ab1266-phi-tc/).

### **Not Recommended For**

* **Listeners Seeking Intimate Musical Experience:** Those wanting to hear vocals and small ensembles intimately, as if performing nearby. The Immanis's grandeur might create distance from the music [31](#ref-31).
* **Users with System Constraints:** Users wanting to avoid additional investment in amps and DACs, or seeking "complete sound from headphones alone." The Immanis strictly demands overall system completeness.
* **Users Sensitive to Weight and Fit:** The 600g+ weight might burden users accustomed to lightweight headphones during extended listening [1](#ref-1).

### **Future Possibilities**

There's significant room for sound tuning through cable changes. Upgrading from the standard STAR-8 MkII to higher-tier cables might reveal even greater heights [7](#ref-7). Also, pairing with direct-drive compatible amps like SAEQ, bypassing the RCDI, might be key to further unlocking the Immanis's potential [32](#ref-32).

### **Overall Rating: ★★★★☆ (4.5/5)**

The RAAL 1995 Immanis is undoubtedly a masterpiece that will be etched in history. It destroys existing concepts of technical trade-offs and presents new possibilities for headphone reproduction. Its breathtaking technical performance and sound that unleashes music's fundamental energy are unforgettable once experienced. However, in exchange for that absolute performance, it demands astronomical cost and the endless pursuit of polishing the entire system to its limits. It's not a mountain everyone can climb. Perhaps that's precisely why the view from its peak is so magnificent and solitary.
