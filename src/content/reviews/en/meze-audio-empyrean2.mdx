Success is sometimes the heaviest shackle for creators. Once a brand creates a product so iconic that it defines an era, doesn't it inevitably bear the cross of "inheritance"? The original Meze Empyrean that debuted in 2018 was precisely such an existence. It was not merely a headphone, but a manifesto of philosophy that fused supreme comfort based on human engineering, warm and musical sound, and the aesthetic beauty of a crafted artifact [1](#ref-1).

The Empyrean opened new frontiers in the high-end audio market as a "functional work of art." Yet this success simultaneously poses the next question: How does one surpass something that seemed to approach perfection? What is the purpose of a sequel? Is it to correct the flaws of its predecessor, to attract new audiences, or to further refine an established formula?

To this dilemma, Romanian Meze Audio and Ukrainian acoustic technology collective Rinaro Isodynamics once again joined hands to present an answer. That answer is the Meze Empyrean II we explore today [3](#ref-3). This is not merely a model change. It is undoubtedly the crystallization of an extremely philosophical endeavor: to face the legacy built by the original and achieve evolution without erasing its identity. We shall dissect this Empyrean II, dive into the depths of its sound, and determine whether the cross of inheritance has been sublimated into blessing.

## **1. Chorus of Voices — Global Reception**

The arrival of a new flagship is like a new performance opening in the theater of the audio community. The Empyrean II is no exception, receiving various voices from critics and enthusiasts worldwide. Before forming our own evaluation, let us first listen to this polyphonic chorus and grasp the objective contours from within those resonances.

| Media | Quote (Translation + Original) | Rating |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Headfonics](https://headfonics.com/meze-audio-empyrean-ii-review/) | "Will not win over fans of the original Empyrean sound... should appeal to a much wider audience than before." [14](#ref-14) | 8.5/10 |
| [What Hi-Fi?](https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/meze-audio-empyrean-ii) | "The lows come through with punch and power... it would be nice to have more free-flowing dynamics." [15](#ref-15) | ★★★★★ |
| [MajorHiFi](https://majorhifi.com/meze-empyrean-ii-review/) | "The Empyrean II finds a way to do the same thing while featuring its strictest stereo accuracy yet." [16](#ref-16) | (No Score) |
| [The HEADPHONE Show (Resolve)](https://forum.headphones.com/t/meze-empyrean-2-official-thread/22280) | "The Empyrean 2 is a massive improvement over the previous models, but its also far more 'normal' for the tuning." [17](#ref-17) | (No Score) |
| [Head-Fi User "Gizm0Guru"](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/meze-audio-empyrean-ii.26869/reviews) | "It is a headphone that sacrifices pure neutrality and takes some artistic liberties with the tuning - and the result is a phenomenal, spacious, warm and glistening sphere of sound..." [18](#ref-18) | ★★★★★ |
| [Reddit User "HeadEuphony"](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ikjkxu/can_a_headphone_be_considered_art_meze_empyrean/) | "Where it falls a bit short to me was on acoustic, jazz and classical music, where its timbre was not on par with the other technical aspects." [19](#ref-19) | (No Score) |
| [Reddit User "rileycw4"](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1jn6jhv/meze_empyrean_1_2/) | "Empyrean 2 is a cleaner sound. It is more technically impressive but less romantic." [20](#ref-20) | (No Score) |

**Analysis and Summary:**
Looking across the reviews, one clear trend emerges. First, there is nearly unanimous praise for build quality, comfort, and aesthetics [14](#ref-14). Regarding sound quality, a consensus forms around the point that compared to the original Empyrean, it has become "clearer, more detailed, and more neutral" [3](#ref-3). This is likely a manifestation of the manufacturer's clear intention to overcome the technical performance sweetness that was sometimes pointed out in the predecessor.

However, this evolution comes with a cost. Some fans of the original lament the loss of its distinctive "romantic" or "magical" character [20](#ref-20). There are also scattered mentions of slight sharpness or harshness in the highs [15](#ref-15), and opinions that dynamics feel somewhat restrained compared to competitors in the same class [15](#ref-15).

What emerges from this is the fact that the Empyrean II is not merely an improvement, but a product intended for strategic market repositioning. Meze has traded some of the original's distinctive, sometimes divisive warmth for more universally acceptable technical proficiency. This is undoubtedly a calculated decision to appeal to a broader audience and establish a firm position in a competitive market. As a result, the Empyrean II may have become a safer, but in some ways less distinctive choice.

## **2. Genesis of Form — The Fusion of Art and Engineering**

To understand Meze Audio's products, one must first touch upon the roots of their philosophy. Founded in 2011 by designer Antonio Meze in Baia Mare, Romania, this brand has consistently pursued "timeless design, durability, and pure comfort" [4](#ref-4). For them, headphones are not disposable electronics, but "heirlooms" that should be passed down through generations [1](#ref-1). This philosophy permeates every corner of the Empyrean II. The commitment to complete repairability, where almost every component can be disassembled and replaced, is perhaps the most eloquent testament to this philosophy [11](#ref-11).

### **Technical Depths: The Rinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array Driver**

What acoustically embodies this philosophy is the Isodynamic Hybrid Array driver, born from collaboration with Ukraine's Rinaro Isodynamics [3](#ref-3). The core of this technology lies in an unprecedented and ingenious approach: placing two different types of voice coils on a single diaphragm [24](#ref-24).

* **Switchback Coil:** A zigzag-shaped coil positioned in the upper part of the driver, optimized for low-frequency reproduction and responsible for creating rich, substantial bass [12](#ref-12).
* **Spiral Coil:** A spiral-shaped coil located in the lower part of the driver, directly above the ear canal. This specializes in mid-to-high frequency reproduction. This placement is intended to minimize temporal delays caused by sound wave reflections in the ear, delivering sound more directly to the eardrum to improve imaging and resolution [12](#ref-12).

The diaphragm driving these two coils is custom polymer film named Rinaro Isoplanar® [MZ3], boasting an astonishing lightness of just 0.16g [5](#ref-5). Combined with a vast effective area of 4650 mm², it enables ultra-high resolution reproduction reaching up to 110,000 Hz. While the Empyrean II maintains this basic structure, it has been tuned to a more neutral and detail-rich sound signature through the development and implementation of new acoustic mesh and damper systems [14](#ref-14). This is Meze's engineering answer to the difficult goal of maintaining the original's musicality while raising technical sophistication.

### **Technical Comparison with Competitors**

The design philosophy of the Empyrean II becomes even clearer through comparison with competing products.

| Feature | Meze Empyrean II | [Audeze LCD-5](/en/reviews/audeze-lcd5) | [Dan Clark Audio Expanse](/en/reviews/danclarkaudio-expanse) | [ZMF Caldera](/en/reviews/zmf-caldera-open) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Driver Type** | Planar Magnetic (Isodynamic Hybrid Array) | Planar Magnetic (Parallel Uniforce™) | Planar Magnetic (V-Planar) | Planar Magnetic (CAMS) |
| **Impedance** | 32 Ω | 14 Ω | ~23 Ω | 60 Ω |
| **Sensitivity** | 105 dB/1V | 90 dB/1mW | Not disclosed | ~95 dB/mW |
| **Weight** | ~455 g | 420 g | 418 g | 490–550 g |
| **Key Technology** | Dual voice coil, Isomagnetic pads | Fluxor™ magnets, Fazor™ waveguides | AMTS waveguides, auto-adjusting strap | CAMS technology, Atrium damping system |
| **Source** | [5](#ref-5) | [27](#ref-27) | [29](#ref-29) | [31](#ref-31) |

What this table reveals is that the Empyrean II prioritizes ease of use and comfort over pursuing extreme technical specifications. The low impedance of 32 Ω and relatively high efficiency of 105 dB/1V enable use with a wide range of amplifiers, including portable sources, in contrast to headphones like the [HIFIMAN Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled) that demand high-power amplification [33](#ref-33). While not the lightest, its excellent weight distribution and suspension system are widely recognized as providing class-leading comfort [14](#ref-14). The dual-coil driver approach also represents an attempt to optimize sound transmission from a more human-engineering perspective rather than pure resolution competition.

Meze's engineering does not occur in a vacuum. It is a direct reflection of their philosophy. The Empyrean II is designed to provide a comprehensively comfortable flagship experience where acoustic performance, comfort, and usability are equally valued. This is the clear raison d'être of the Empyrean II against competitors that are more technically cutting-edge or physically challenging.

### **2.5. Objective Indicators — Acoustic Characteristics from Measurement Data**

To complement subjective listening impressions and objectively understand acoustic behavior, measurement data serves as an indispensable compass. The Empyrean II shows interesting measurement results that support its tuning evolution [17](#ref-17).

#### **Frequency Response**

  sourceTitle="Meze Empyrean2 Raw - The Headphones Community"
  sourceUrl="https://forum.headphones.com/t/meze-empyrean-2-official-thread/22280"
/>

The measurement data clearly visualizes the acoustic personality differences brought by the two types of ear pads [17](#ref-17).

* **Duo (Hybrid) Pads:** The frequency response with these pads draws a gentle V-shape. This is tuning that balances warm bass lift with high-frequency energy to ensure clarity, which is why it's described as sounding like "[Sennheiser HD 800 S](/en/reviews/sennheiser-hd800s) with added bass warmth" [17](#ref-17). However, several measurements confirm a notable peak around 6kHz, which may be the cause of high-frequency sharpness pointed out in some reviews [17](#ref-17). There's also a tendency for the mid-bass (upper bass) to sound somewhat thick [17](#ref-17).

  sourceTitle="Meze Empyrean2 (Calibrated) - The Headphones Community"
  sourceUrl="https://forum.headphones.com/t/meze-empyrean-2-official-thread/22280"
/>

* **Angled Alcantara (Suede) Pads:** Changing pads dramatically alters the characteristics. The bass lift seen with Duo pads is resolved, shifting to an overall brighter, leaner presentation [17](#ref-17). This can be called an option for users who prefer more neutral and analytical listening. The removal of mid-bass thickness also provides the advantage of easier EQ adjustments [17](#ref-17).

  sourceUrl="https://forum.headphones.com/t/meze-empyrean-2-official-thread/22280"
/>

#### **Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)**

The THD characteristics of the Empyrean II must be called extremely excellent. According to measurements, even at the loud 90dB level, distortion remains below 0.2% in most bands, with 2nd and 3rd harmonics being dominant [17](#ref-17). Even more remarkable is maintaining this low distortion at 110dB, a sound pressure level dangerous to hearing [17](#ref-17). This means the driver design is very robust and doesn't lose linearity even under high input. This characteristic provides the significant practical advantage that users need not worry about sound quality degradation from distortion even when making bold tonal adjustments with EQ, particularly substantial bass boosts [17](#ref-17).

/>

#### **Analysis**

This measurement data objectively supports many subjective evaluations that the Empyrean II has achieved "massive improvement" from the original and evolved to more "normal" tuning [17](#ref-17). Meze attempted to strike a skillful balance between the original's distinctive character and the technical performance demanded in today's high-end market. The result is this extremely low-distortion, technically mature headphone with two different faces via ear pads [17](#ref-17).

## **3. Auditory Experience — Impressionist Descriptions**

We shall now fill the blueprint of technical specifications with the colors of sensation. Here, we attempt to vividly depict the sonic world that the Empyrean II creates, borrowing words from other critics while also filtering through my own ears. The acoustic transformation brought by the two types of ear pads is particularly crucial to this headphone's essence.

| [Headfonics](https://headfonics.com/meze-audio-empyrean-ii-review/) | "...this is a very different-sounding headphone to the one that came out five years ago." [14](#ref-14) |

### **Listening Impressions**

#### **With Duo Ear Pads ("Modern Meze Sound")**

The Duo pads, composed of hybrid leather and Alcantara materials, bring out the more musical and passionate side of the Empyrean II [15](#ref-15). This can be called a reinterpretation of traditional Meze house sound with higher resolution.

**In classical music**, listening to Dvořák's Symphony No. 9 "From the New World," the string sections rise with rich resonance, and timpani strikes carry authoritative weight [15](#ref-15). Instrument separation is good, with each section presenting a grand sense of scale without muddiness. However, compared to top competitors, the expression of space between instruments—the so-called "air"—may be somewhat reserved, with moments where the soundstage feels dense [15](#ref-15).

**In jazz**, such as Bill Evans Trio performances, the Duo pads' warmth gives pleasant thickness to piano tones, and the vibration of wood bass strings conveys with realistic texture [15](#ref-15). Vocals are clear and expressive, providing immersive feelings as if listening to a performance in an intimate space [36](#ref-36). This provides a relaxed listening experience that doesn't cause fatigue during extended sessions.

**In EDM and hip-hop**, these pads show their true value. Powerful, punchy bass provides solid foundation for beats and moves the listener's body [36](#ref-36). Even in complex productions like Kanye West's "POWER," each sampled element separates clearly, constructing an energetic overall picture without becoming chaotic [36](#ref-36).

#### **With Angled Alcantara Ear Pads ("Technical Sound")**

Switching to the angled all-Alcantara pads completely transforms the Empyrean II's character. The sound shifts toward a more neutral and analytical direction, giving the impression of handling a different headphone [14](#ref-14).

**In classical music**, the soundstage density felt with Duo pads fades, revealing a more expansive and airy space [15](#ref-15). Instrument separation further improves, and details like orchestral nuances and hall reverb emerge more clearly. This becomes a significant advantage when analytically listening to complex compositions.

**In jazz**, bass warmth recedes to faster, tighter expression [21](#ref-21). This makes cymbal metallic resonance and piano attacks more prominent, sharpening the overall performance outline. Vocals come more forward, showing resolution where even breathing can be felt, though the rich emotion that Duo pads possessed may somewhat fade.

**In EDM and rock**, reduced bass quantity changes the overall sound balance. As some reviewers point out, these pads may show energy peaks in the lower treble, potentially making synthesizers and distorted guitars sound somewhat sharp and stimulating [15](#ref-15). This is a trade-off that occurs in exchange for higher resolution.

#### **Soundstage and Imaging**

Regardless of ear pad type, the Empyrean II's imaging and separation capabilities are consistently excellent [16](#ref-16). Its soundstage doesn't artificially create vast expanses but draws realistic, focused space. This creates an intimate yet immersive experience, as if listening in a studio control room or front row of a live venue [16](#ref-16). This is a clear evolution point, gaining broader and more three-dimensional expression than the original Empyrean [36](#ref-36).

These two ear pads are not mere accessories. They are choices in acoustic philosophy that Meze presents to users. The Isomagnetic™ technology's easy attachment mechanism [14](#ref-14) allows users to freely change the headphone's character according to mood or musical genre. This remarkable versatility is precisely what elevates the Empyrean II from merely an excellent headphone to something truly special.

## **4. Balance Sheet — Critical Evaluation**

No work of art can escape the judgment called criticism. Here, we attempt to evaluate the Empyrean II from multiple perspectives and objectively measure its value. By equally placing positive and negative aspects on the table, we want to approach its essence.

| Evaluation Axis | Score (out of 5) | Commentary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | ★★★★☆ | The leap in detail and imaging from the predecessor deserves praise. The range of tonal adjustment through the dual pad system is also broad. However, compared to top competitors like [Focal Utopia](/en/reviews/focal-utopia-sg), dynamics feel somewhat restrained, and high-frequency sharpness when using Alcantara pads prevents a perfect score. |
| **Musical Charm** | ★★★★☆ | The musical and emotionally rich expression, especially with Duo pads, is incomparable. It establishes a rare balance between technical ability and pure listening pleasure. It vividly depicts music without falling into sterile analysis. This is the headphone's greatest strength. |
| **Build Quality** | ★★★★★ | Simply perfect. CNC-machined aluminum, carbon fiber headband, and meticulous assembly down to fine details have established new industry standards. It possesses the dignity of a true luxury object that can withstand decades of use. |
| **Price-to-Value** | ★★★★☆ | The $3,000 price faces fierce competition. However, considering the two different sound signatures (via pads), high-quality case and cables, and world-class comfort and build quality provided in one package, sufficient value can be found. |
| **Future-Proofing / Serviceability** | ★★★★★ | A core element of Meze philosophy. Complete repairability where all parts are replaceable is a major advantage over many competitors. This guarantees long-term ownership and enhances the justification of initial investment. |

**In technical performance**, the clarity improvement from the original is evident to any ear [14](#ref-14). However, as some critics point out, there may be slight restraint felt in expressing the peaks and valleys of dynamic range [15](#ref-15). Also, the high-frequency energy when using Alcantara pads might sound stimulating to sensitive ears depending on source [16](#ref-16).

**Musical charm** is the soul of the Empyrean II. It inherits the original's "easy to listen" characteristic [3](#ref-3) while possessing the ability to transform long listening sessions into pure pleasure without becoming overly analytical [38](#ref-38). Its power to capture music's emotional core and deliver it directly to the listener is remarkable even in this price range.

**Build quality and comfort** are unquestionably at the highest level. The fit described as "melting into the head" [36](#ref-36) and the premium feel transmitted from the moment you hold it deeply satisfies the joy of ownership [14](#ref-14). Functionality and beauty are magnificently fused here.

When considering **price-to-value**, we're not just looking at the headphone body price. The $2,999 price includes a complete ecosystem: robust case, two sets of ear pads, high-quality cables, and the long-term peace of mind that repairability provides [11](#ref-11).

**Future-proofing and repairability** most vividly reflects Meze's philosophy. The design allowing easy replacement of consumables like ear pads and headbands elevates this product from a transient gadget to an "instrument" for long-term companionship [23](#ref-23). This holds extremely important value in our modern era where sustainability is questioned.

## **5. Among the Gods — Comprehensive Analysis**

To understand the star called Empyrean II, we must survey the constellation it resides in—the entire high-end headphone market. This market is a gathering of specialists, each radiating their unique brilliance. There's the ultra-high resolution but extremely difficult to drive **[HIFIMAN Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled)**, the clinically precise and lightweight **[Audeze LCD-5](/en/reviews/audeze-lcd5)**, the dynamic driver pinnacle **[Focal Utopia](/en/reviews/focal-utopia-sg)**, and the warm, woodcraft-like **[ZMF Caldera](/en/reviews/zmf-caldera-open)**.

Among these formidable competitors, it seems the Empyrean II didn't aim to reach the summit in any single metric. It's neither the most detailed, most dynamic, nor most neutral headphone. Its true value lies in integrating and perfecting areas that competitors often sacrifice.

1. **Unparalleled Comfort:** When considering the essence of long-term music appreciation, the probably most comfortable fit in the market that the Empyrean II provides holds decisive value [15](#ref-15).
2. **Easy Driveability:** Its design not requiring thousands of dollars in dedicated amplification reduces total system cost and opens doors to more audiophiles [33](#ref-33).
3. **Aesthetic and Tactile Pleasure:** Its design provides the joy of ownership not only as an acoustic device but as a work of art, enriching the musical experience [3](#ref-3).
4. **Tonal Versatility:** The dual pad system enables changing character according to user preference and musical genre, establishing its position as an exceptional all-rounder [21](#ref-21).

This product's existence poses an important question in high-end audio: "What is the best headphone?" The Empyrean II's answer is clear. It's not the one with the best measurements, but the one that provides the most joy and least friction in daily use. This is a flagship designed for humans, not oscilloscopes.

### **Position Within the Bloodline**

* **vs. Original Empyrean:** This is an evolution that clearly steered toward technicality. The II is for listeners who loved the original's concept but desired higher clarity and precision. Meanwhile, the original continues as a unique existence for those who prioritize its distinctive, warm, "dreamy" character above all else [20](#ref-20).
* **vs. [Elite](/en/reviews/meze-audio-elite):** The Elite remains Meze's true flagship, offering superior resolution, speed, and holographic soundstage at a higher price ($4,000) [2](#ref-2). The Empyrean II is a more "fun," bass-focused choice suitable for contemporary genres, while the Elite shows its true value in complex classical and acoustic recordings [36](#ref-36).

The true innovation of the Empyrean II lies not in its acoustic performance alone. It lies in the user-centric design philosophy that systematically eliminates the pain points often associated with high-end experiences (weight, difficult amplification, repair anxiety). Its value should be found in the totality of the ownership experience.

## **6. Conclusion and Those Whose Souls Resonate**

Our long exploration finally reaches its destination. Through extensive analysis and listening, the essence of the Meze Empyrean II seems to crystallize into one word: "harmony."

The Empyrean II has achieved magnificent evolution as the successor to a modern classic. It accomplishes the difficult task of reaching higher technical sophistication without completely abandoning the warmth and musicality that defined its predecessor. Its greatest strengths lie in incomparable comfort, craft-level build quality, and the remarkable versatility brought by the dual pad system.

### **Recommended User Profile**

* Audiophiles who equally value beauty, comfort, and sound as the complete experience.
* Listeners who traverse diverse musical genres and seek a versatile unit that can balance "fun" and "analysis."
* Those who want to enjoy summit-level sound without necessarily requiring summit-level amplifier systems.
* People who loved the original Empyrean's concept and yearned for additional clarity and detail.

### **Users Who Should Avoid This Headphone**

* Purists who above all pursue absolute detail reproduction and neutrality. (In that case, [Susvara](/en/reviews/hifiman-susvara-unveiled) or [LCD-5](/en/reviews/audeze-lcd5) would come into view)
* Audiophiles who prioritize cost-performance. (Better value options like HIFIMAN HE1000se exist)
* Devoted followers of the original Empyrean's distinctive warm, laid-back sound. (For them, the II might feel too "normal" and sterile)

### **Future Possibilities**

Its modular structure holds potential for further sound quality tuning through third-party ear pads and cables in the future. This also provides the joy of owners "growing" this headphone according to their preferences.

### **Overall Rating: ★★★★☆**

The Meze Empyrean II is not merely an acoustic device. It is undoubtedly a thoughtfully crafted work of art that enriches the very act of daily listening. This single unit quietly yet eloquently tells the story of the ideal relationship that should exist between technology and sensibility, function and aesthetics, and creator and user.
