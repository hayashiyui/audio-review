Vienna—a city where music and precision engineering have historically intersected. The spiritual legacy of the prestigious AKG Acoustics, deeply engraved in this city's acoustic history, took a new path with a shocking decision in 2017. The shocking news of Vienna headquarters closure marked both the end of an era and became an unexpected seed of creation [1](#ref-1). Austrian Audio was founded by 22 engineers who formed AKG's core, carrying their technology and philosophy in their hearts [1](#ref-1). Their first flagship headphones "The Composer" is not merely a new product. It is nothing less than a declaration of intent to inherit Vienna's reverberations and perform new movements.

Interestingly, The Composer's design carries distinct traces of the K812, AKG's last Vienna-made flagship [3](#ref-3). The K812 was an ambitious product but reportedly suffered from a fatal flaw—sharp sibilance around 9kHz due to unresolved resonance issues from rushing to mass production [4](#ref-4). The Composer inherits K812's structural concept while mounting newly developed drivers with Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coating, perfectly overcoming past weaknesses. This is surely no coincidence. Putting an end to an "unfinished symphony" they once crafted, using modern technology and a free environment—The Composer's existence can perhaps be read as a story of these engineers' obsession and pride. This article will elucidate from multiple angles the technological lineage and acoustic capabilities this noteworthy headphone encompasses.

Summary:
Among the 10 major sources surveyed, most highly evaluate its technical performance and sound quality. Particularly, praise concentrates on clarity, detail expression, and exceptional bass characteristics for a dynamic driver. However, there seems to be room for debate regarding pricing, unique cable connectors, and midrange tuning pointed out by some users.

However, it should be noted that many of these reviews are based on samples provided by the manufacturer [3](#ref-3). The possibility that initial enthusiasm for new products or unconscious bias influenced evaluations cannot be denied. While referring to these evaluations, we must discern this machine's true value from a more critical perspective.

## **2. Design Philosophy and Technical Lineage**

To understand The Composer's acoustic performance, we need to delve deeply into its heart—the driver technology and seemingly peculiar design choices.

### **Hi-X Driver Philosophy and Evolution through DLC**

At the core of Austrian Audio's headphone design is their proprietary "High Excursion (Hi-X)" driver technology. The 44mm Hi-X drivers used in their other models aim to achieve extremely fast impulse response and low distortion through a powerful ring magnet system that increases magnetic flux density, improves airflow, and combines with mass-reduced copper-clad aluminum voice coils [2](#ref-2).

The Composer mounts a newly developed 49mm "Hi-X49 DLC" driver that further advances this philosophy. Its greatest feature is the Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coating applied to the diaphragm [21](#ref-21). DLC is a material with extremely high rigidity comparable to diamond while minimizing mass increase [22](#ref-22). In acoustic engineering, driver diaphragms must maintain ideal "piston motion," but as frequency increases, the diaphragm itself distorts and causes break-up modes (resonance). This break-up mode becomes the main cause of distortion and sound muddiness [22](#ref-22). By dramatically increasing diaphragm rigidity through DLC coating, it becomes possible to push break-up modes far above the audible range. The result is extremely low distortion, transparent sound with excellent transient response across the entire audible range. The "clear highs without harshness" and "astonishing speed" mentioned in many reviews are undoubtedly backed by DLC material's physical properties [14](#ref-14).

### **Banana Jack Connector Philosophy**

The most controversial aspect of The Composer's design is adopting "Banana Jack" rather than common 3.5mm or mini-XLR connectors for the headphone-side cable connection. Many reviewers criticize this as "not audiophile-friendly," drawing complaints from those who prefer switching to third-party cables [13](#ref-13).

However, dismissing this choice as mere gimmick would be hasty. As one forum user aptly points out, while uncommon for headphones, this is an extremely standard and reliable connector for electronic components [25](#ref-25). Banana plugs excel at ensuring large contact area and maintaining reliable electrical connections over long periods. For engineers wanting to eliminate even one factor causing sound quality degradation, this is a rational choice.

This single design philosophy eloquently tells Austrian Audio's philosophy. Rather than pandering to the hobby-oriented trend of cable swapping, they prioritized reliability as measurement equipment and robustness as pro audio equipment. This might reflect their pride that they're creating not mere luxury items but "instruments" or "measurement devices" for accurate sound reproduction.

### **Understanding Acoustic Design from Measurement Data**

Published measurement data confirms that The Composer is an extremely intentional and precisely tuned headphone. Objective data like frequency response and distortion rates serve as compass points supporting our auditory impressions.

**Frequency Response**
The overall "neutral-bright" characteristic suggests similarity to Sennheiser HD 800 S [16](#ref-16). However, clear design philosophy can be seen in details. Most notably, bass characteristics extending flat to 20Hz—exceptional for open-back dynamic types [16](#ref-16). This rivals planar magnetic performance in sub-bass reproduction, providing clear advantage over HD 800 S [16](#ref-16). The auditory impression of "deep, distortion-free bass" is backed by this data [18](#ref-18). The midrange has intentional dip around 2kHz, likely characteristic tuning seen in other company models aimed at creating wider soundstage perception. Treble peaks around 6kHz but shows less sharpness than HD 800 S, suggesting intention to technically overcome the 9kHz resonance challenge that AKG K812 faced [4](#ref-4).

/>

**Harmonic Distortion**
At normal listening levels (95dB), distortion is extremely low across all frequencies, objectively demonstrating the DLC driver's excellence [16](#ref-16). However, at high volumes (105dB), bass distortion tends to increase, suggesting it may not have the same tolerance as some planar magnetic types for extreme bass boosting with EQ [16](#ref-16). Nevertheless, the manufacturer's claimed "THD < 0.1% (@ 1kHz)" specification sufficiently demonstrates this machine's high potential [11](#ref-11).

  sourceUrl="https://forum.headphones.com/t/austrian-audio-the-composer-official-discussion-thread/22480"
/>

**Impedance**
The low 22Ω impedance is confirmed by measurement data, showing easy-to-drive design for modern diverse playback environments [16](#ref-16). However, since the impedance curve isn't perfectly flat, pairing with low output impedance source equipment is desirable for faithful reproduction of intended sound [16](#ref-16).

/>

This objective data reveals that The Composer is not merely a sensory product but exists close to "acoustic measurement equipment," created extremely precisely based on scientific knowledge and acoustic engineering.

### **Spec Comparison with Competitors**

To objectively understand what market The Composer entered, let's compare specifications with major competing products in the same price range.

| Model (Brand) | Type (Open/Driver) | Impedance | Sensitivity | Weight | Price (USD) | Features |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Composer (Austrian Audio)** | **Open/Dynamic (DLC)** | **22Ω** | **112 dBspl/V** | **385 g** | **$2,699** | **Ultra-low distortion, high efficiency, DLC diaphragm** |
| [Utopia (Focal, 2022)](/reviews/focal-utopia-sg/) [26](#ref-26) | Open/Dynamic (Be "M" dome) | 80Ω | 104 dB @1mW | 490 g | $4,999 | Flagship DD, micro-expression and texture |
| [HD 800 S (Sennheiser)](/reviews/sennheiser-hd800s/) [27](#ref-27) | Open/Dynamic | 300Ω | 102 dB @1V | 330 g | $1,699 | Ultra-wide soundstage and resolution |
| [Empyrean II (Meze)](/reviews/meze-audio-empyrean2) [28](#ref-28) | Open/Planar | 32Ω | 105 dB @1V | 385 g | $2,999 | Elliptical Hybrid Array, rich and listenable |
| [LCD-5 (Audeze)](/reviews/audeze-lcd5/) | Open/Planar | 14Ω | 90 dB/1mW | 420 g | $4,500 | Flagship, precise, high-speed response |
| [SUSVARA (HiFiMAN)](/reviews/hifiman-susvara/) | Open/Planar | 60Ω | 83 dB/mW | 450 g | $6,000 | Ultra high-end, high power requirement |
| [D8000 Pro (final)](/reviews/final-d8000pro/) | Open/Planar (AFDS) | 60Ω | 98 dB/mW | 523 g | $4,299 | Pro-oriented tuning, low distortion |
| [ATH-ADX5000 (Audio-Technica)](/reviews/audio-technica-ath-adx5000/) | Open/Dynamic | 420Ω | 100 dB/mW | 270 g | $1,999 | Ultra-lightweight, high-impedance orthodox |

This table reveals The Composer's unique positioning. The extremely low 22Ω impedance and high 112 dBspl/V sensitivity show completely different design philosophy from competing high-end dynamics (HD 800 S: 300Ω, ATH-ADX5000: 420Ω). This can be called a strategic choice intended for adaptation to modern playback environments that don't require powerful headphone amplifiers.

## **3. Sound Portrait — Listening Impressions**

The sound The Composer creates is, in a word, "lucid." However, the substance of this lucidity harbors unique personality that distinguishes it from simple analyticity.

| Reviewer / Media | Quote Excerpt (Translation + Original) | Source URL |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| MajorHiFi | "the bass is not its main focus, but the tone is still presented with even volume and subtle details." | [15](#ref-15) |
| Reddit User "u/Zernium" | "What happens when you combine the punch of a dynamic with the extension of a planar? Well you get a very good bass response." | [17](#ref-17) |
| What Hi-Fi? | "Given that they are an open-back design we're pleased to note that The Composer deliver lows with a surprising amount of muscle." | [12](#ref-12) |
| Reddit User "u/lewdish" | "a notable dip around 2khz...Ear gain around 3khz is right on the edge of where I like it, and then a bit of brightness in the treble." | [16](#ref-16) |

### **Acoustic Characteristics That Could Be Called "Dynamic-Planar"**

To most accurately express The Composer's sound, it would be the fusion of "dynamic driver dynamism" with "planar magnetic driver linearity." Traditionally, dynamic types excel at midrange "punch" or "slam" but tend to lack sub-bass extension. Conversely, planar magnetics are attractive for linear bass extending flat to sub-bass but may lack the physical impact of dynamics [17](#ref-17).

The Composer seems to transcend this dichotomy by combining both merits. As many listeners point out, its bass dives surprisingly deep and distortion-free for open-back dynamic [18](#ref-18). Simultaneously, in transient response like kick drum attacks, it maintains the sharp rise time and speed characteristic of dynamics. One reviewer's description as "dynamic HiFiMAN" [17](#ref-17) captures this unique characteristic with keen insight. This must be the acoustic result of technical achievement made possible by high-rigidity DLC diaphragm and powerful magnetic circuit.

### **Genre-Specific Impressions**

**Classical Music:** With large orchestral works like Mahler symphonies, The Composer's true value shines. Its imaging performance that precisely depicts each instrument's position while remaining vast without becoming scattered is spectacular [7](#ref-7). The DLC driver's high-speed response reproduces everything from explosive tutti dynamics to pianissimo's subtle nuances without breakdown, never saturating sound in complex passages. The soundstage isn't the extraordinary width of Sennheiser HD 800 S but presents more natural, controlled concert hall acoustics.

**Jazz:** Listening to Bill Evans Trio recordings, one gasps at its micro-detail expression. Piano harmonic resonance, cymbal legato's delicate metallic sounds, and especially acoustic bass body resonance are depicted with astonishing realism [14](#ref-14). It possesses the "foundation" presence of bass instruments that many analytical headphones struggle with, contributing to overall musical stability. The midrange, perhaps influenced by the 2kHz dip some point out [16](#ref-16), doesn't have vocals or instruments excessively forward. However, this might create natural distance and spatial spread, becoming a factor preventing listening fatigue during long sessions.

**Electronic / Rock:** With rhythmic tracks like Public Service Broadcasting, the aforementioned "dynamic-planar" characteristics come alive. Synth bass's deep-diving low end and electronic drums' sharp attacks are beautifully balanced, accurately and powerfully depicting groove [12](#ref-12). The claimed low THD in low frequencies [11](#ref-11) manifests not as mere specification numbers but as mudless, clean bass in actual musical experience. Treble is very extended and detail-rich but never harsh, beautifully reproducing synthesizer's brilliant tones.

## **4. Value Analysis — Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**

Does The Composer provide value worthy of its price? Let's evaluate technical performance, musical appeal, and product completeness from multiple angles.

| Evaluation Axis | Score (out of 5) | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | 4.5 | DLC driver's clarity, speed, and low distortion at highest level. Imaging extremely accurate. Achieved groundbreaking bass extension for dynamic type. Soundstage width not class-leading but very high quality. |
| **Musical Appeal** | 4.0 | Shows unparalleled appeal in genres requiring analytical listening like classical, jazz, acoustic. Neutral-bright tonality and midrange characteristics might feel somewhat cool to listeners seeking heat or thickness in rock/pop. |
| **Build Quality** | 5.0 | Masterful craftsmanship gathering precision engineering's essence. Premium materials, surprising lightness, abundant adjustment mechanisms provide class-leading comfort for most users. |
| **Price-Performance Value** | 3.5 | Entered fiercely competitive price range. While performance is high, sometimes engages in "give-and-take battles" with cheaper HD 800 S [16](#ref-16). This machine's value lies in unique acoustic characteristics and easy driving that reduces overall system costs. |
| **Future-proofing / Repairability** | 4.5 | Manufacturer promises full repair support [13](#ref-13). Ear pads are magnetic-mount for easy user replacement. Banana Jack connectors are highly durable. Long-term parts supply system is the only concern. |

### **Positive / Negative Factors Consideration (Bias Check)**

Praiseworthy Points:
The Composer's greatest achievement is realizing reference-level resolution without harsh highs. And the deep, linear bass characteristics that overturn dynamic driver conventions are particularly noteworthy. Packaging these in exceptional build quality with astonishing comfort that makes long use effortless should be highly evaluated. Furthermore, easy driving becomes a strategic element determining this machine's value, as discussed later.

Points for Consideration:
However, its price is far from cheap, and the market is crowded with powerful rivals. Banana Jack connectors present clear constraints for those who enjoy cable swapping. Also, as What Hi-Fi? pointed out, narrow headband adjustment range potentially not fitting users with smaller heads is an unacceptable design flaw [12](#ref-12). And the tuning that slightly recesses 2kHz, while intentional sound design, won't match all music or all listeners' preferences. Particularly those emphasizing vocal texture or electric guitar "bite" might find it lacking.

## **5. Considering Existence Significance in High-End Market**

What existence significance does The Composer seek to establish in the brutal high-end headphone market? Let's decipher its strategy and philosophy through competitor comparisons.

### **Confronting Major Competitors**

* **vs. [Sennheiser HD 800 S](/reviews/sennheiser-hd800s/):** This can be called a new-vs-old battle for the analytical headphone throne. While HD 800 S continues reigning with absolute soundstage width and unique openness, The Composer provides much superior bass quantity and quality, plus smoother, more listenable highs for more complete total balance [16](#ref-16). If HD 800 S is a specialist pursuing specific performance to extremes, The Composer is a modern all-rounder handling more music at high levels.
* **vs. [Focal Utopia (2022)](/reviews/focal-utopia-sg/):** A philosophical clash between dynamic flagship siblings. While The Composer pursues neutrality and vast spatial expression, Utopia seeks soul-stirring impact and vivid texture within more concentrated soundstage [17](#ref-17). The Composer's bass extends deep but rationally, while Utopia's delivers powerful punches. This equals choosing between concert hall acoustics or front-row studio console seats.
* **vs. [Meze Empyrean II](/reviews/meze-audio-empyrean2/):** This contrasts purposes. If The Composer is precise measurement equipment for analytically dissecting music, Empyrean II is luxurious art for immersing in and surrendering to music's resonance [13](#ref-13). Empyrean II's rich, warm tonality stands opposite to The Composer's cool objectivity. It's not about which is superior, but two different answers to the fundamental question of what listeners seek from headphones—analysis or rapture.

### **Strategic Positioning: "Accessible Flagship Experience"**

To understand The Composer's true value requires considering not just individual performance but positioning within entire audio systems. Some ultra high-end headphones like [HiFiMAN Susvara](/reviews/hifiman-susvara/) demand equally expensive, powerful amplifiers to maximize performance. This means double investment for users, raising barriers to flagship experiences.

Here lies Austrian Audio's clever strategy. The Composer is designed extremely easy to drive with 22Ω low impedance and high sensitivity [14](#ref-14). This means high-end portable players or mid-class desktop amps can extract most of its potential. This distinguishes it from Susvara or HD 800 S, which benefits from quality amplification for true performance.

In other words, Austrian Audio strategically positions The Composer not just in acoustic performance but "system value." This is an extremely realistic and intelligent approach for modern audiophiles who find it difficult to build cost-no-object dedicated systems. There lies essential value proposition invisible in simple price comparisons.

## **6. Conclusion & Recommended Users**

Austrian Audio The Composer is an extremely excellent reference headphone born from Vienna's great acoustic tradition and polished by modern technology. It's an ambitious attempt to embody in one driver the contradictory virtues of dynamic dynamism and planar magnetic extension, achieving this goal at high levels. It's a crystallization of precision engineering that balances clarity with musicality.

**Who Should Listen to This Sound**

* **Analytical Listeners:** Those wanting to enjoy classical, jazz, acoustic music with microscopic clarity [16](#ref-16).
* **Those Seeking Modern HD 800 S:** Those who love HD 800 S resolution but have craved more balanced bass and non-harsh highs.
* **Realistic Audiophiles:** Those wanting to build flagship experiences system-wide without assuming investment in ultimate amplifiers.

**Who Should Reconsider Purchase**

* **Those Seeking Warmth and Richness:** Those preferring romantic, rich sounds like Meze Empyrean II or ZMF Vérité.
* **Aggressive Music Fans:** Those subsisting on hard rock/metal who prioritize midrange thickness and "biting" texture.
* **Cable Swapping Explorers:** Those who find joy in trying abundant third-party cables. Banana Jack connectors will be barriers.

Future Prospects:
The low-distortion driver suggests extremely high tolerance for EQ sound quality adjustments [16](#ref-16). This leaves room for users to actively customize sound to their preferences, such as correcting midrange dips.

### **Overall Rating: ★★★★☆ (4.0/5)**

The Composer is not merely a successor. It's a true innovator created with deep respect for history and clear vision for the future. Its sound is nothing less than new Vienna resonance that all audiophiles should hear at least once.
