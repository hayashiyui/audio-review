The term "reference monitor" in the audio world implies a certain absolute standard. It suggests an ideal of perfection as a measuring instrument – colorless, distortionless, faithfully converting recorded signals into air movement alone. Yet we must ask ourselves: does the perfect measuring instrument produce perfect art? This question lies at the very heart of what Bowers & Wilkins (hereafter B&W) has explored throughout the long history of their 800 Series. They have consistently stood at the intersection where recording studios demand cold "truth" and audiophiles seek sensual "beauty" [1](#ref-1).

The 805 D4 presented here, while the smallest model in this flagship line, can arguably be called the most concentrated expression of its design philosophy. It represents the crystallization of a fundamental challenge: distilling the essence of massive floor-standing references like the 801 D4 into a compact two-way format. The tension between physical constraints and acoustic ambition. This article is a journey of contemplation, seeking to unravel the conflict inherent in this remarkable speaker called the 805 D4, and the sonic achievements it brings forth.

## **1. Media Evaluation Overview**

| Media | Quote Excerpt (Original) | Rating | Bias Assessment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [What Hi-Fi?](https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/bowers-and-wilkins-805-d4-speakers) | "Class-leading clarity and resolution... Open, agile and articulate." | ★★★★★ | Professional magazine review using manufacturer-provided samples. Tends to highlight positive aspects, but basic sound quality descriptions are highly reliable. |
| [The Absolute Sound](https://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/2023-golden-ear-bowers-and-wilkins-805-d4-loudspeaker/) | "...the B&W has bass quantity and quality to kill for... can create a soundstage with a scale unheard of from a speaker of its size." | Golden Ear Award 2023 | Highly regarded specialist publication. Review based on provided samples. "Golden Ear" award indicates strong positive evaluation, but analysis is detailed and trustworthy. |
| [Stereophile (Measurements)](https://www.stereophile.com/content/bowers-wilkins-805-d4-signature-loudspeaker-measurements) | "The B&W's waterfall plot is superbly clean... but its high-frequency response is, for want of a better word, 'tailored.'" | N/A | Objective laboratory measurements. Essential for technical analysis. The expression "tailored" neutrally describes non-flat frequency response, supporting user claims of "brightness." |
| [SoundStage! Ultra](https://www.soundstageultra.com/index.php/equipment-menu/1061-bowers-wilkins-805-d4-loudspeakers) | "The 805 D4 is not a neutral loudspeaker... if you don't want to listen so much as to be thrilled, then the 805 D4 may be your endgame." | Reviewer's Choice | Nuanced perspective viewing non-neutral characteristics as intentional "vivid and exciting" sound design. Relatively little bias. |
| [Reddit User](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1gh6g16/its_happening_in_my_listening_room_meta_r3_and/) | "To my ears... the highs were detailed and open, but not 'edgy' or overly bright." | Positive | User review. Strong subjective bias, but valuable as counter-evidence to excessive brightness claims. Suggests importance of system matching (Luxman amplifier). |
| [YouTube User Comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VogDCKK_BFM) | "At first, I found the bass too much and boomy, now they are sounding just right... The diamond tweeter is just so natural." | Positive (after break-in) | Owner's actual experience. Points to importance of break-in period often overlooked in short-term professional reviews. |

**Summary:** Most professional media reviews praise the 805 D4's class-leading clarity, resolution, and build quality. Its ability to create an expansive soundstage unimaginable from its size is a repeatedly mentioned theme. However, objective measurement data and user forum discussions point to intentionally "tailored" or "hot" high-frequency characteristics. The bass is consistently rated as tight, clear, and impressive for its size, but comes with the caveat that subwoofers would be needed to satisfy the full spectrum, as it cannot transcend physical laws. Overall, evaluations are extremely positive, but careful system matching to skillfully control its distinctive high frequencies will be key to success.

## **2. Engineering as Art — Technical Depths**

When we view the design of the 805 D4 not as a mere assembly of components, but as an integrated system where each element serves a specific acoustic purpose, its true value becomes apparent. At its foundation lies B&W's decades-long obsession with attempting to acoustically erase the speaker cabinet from the acoustic equation [1](#ref-1).

### **Diamond Dome Tweeter and Solid Body**

What defines the 805 D4's acoustic signature is undoubtedly the diamond dome tweeter. Artificial diamond generated through chemical vapor deposition, with its unparalleled stiffness-to-weight ratio, represents near-ideal material for tweeter diaphragms [5](#ref-5). This pushes the frequency at which breakup modes (so-called "ringing") occur far beyond the audible range to 70kHz, resulting in extremely low-distortion, pure high-frequency reproduction [18](#ref-18).

Housing this exceptional unit is the "Solid Body Tweeter-On-Top" machined from solid aluminum. This is not merely a design feature. The tapered tube extending rearward inherits the technical philosophy of the company's monumental model "Nautilus," serving to absorb and dampen unwanted energy radiated from the diaphragm's rear [5](#ref-5). In the D4 generation, this tube has been lengthened compared to the D3 generation, implementing steady improvements to enhance energy absorption efficiency [3](#ref-3).

### **Continuum Cone**

Replacing the yellow Kevlar cone that had long been B&W's symbol is the Continuum cone made from a proprietary composite textile material. Its design philosophy centers on "optimized, controlled flexibility" [2](#ref-2). While conventional rigid diaphragms cause sudden breakup vibrations that muddy sound when exceeding their operational limits, the Continuum cone exhibits more predictable and gentle behavior. This dramatically improves openness and neutrality in the midrange, enabling more faithful reproduction of voice and instrument textures.

### **Cabinet as System**

The greatest evolution in the 805 D4 can be said to lie in the cabinet structure itself.

* **Reverse-Wrap Cabinet:** For the first time in an 805 model, the same "reverse-wrap" structure as upper models has been adopted. This is a technology that forms the front baffle and side panels from a single laminated plywood sheet using heat and pressure [9](#ref-9). By eliminating joints, structural rigidity is dramatically increased and resonance suppressed. This represents a fundamental structural change from the 805 D3's flat baffle [13](#ref-13).
* **Matrix Bracing:** The internal reinforcement structure "Matrix," a B&W tradition since 1987, has also evolved. The material has changed from D3 generation's MDF to stronger plywood, with aluminum reinforcement added at key points. This skeletal structure aims to make cabinet walls as acoustically inert as possible, thoroughly eliminating unwanted coloration [2](#ref-2).
* **Rear-Mounted Crossover:** The crossover network is mounted on an aluminum spine at the cabinet's rear. This isolates delicate electronic components from air pressure fluctuations and vibrations within the cabinet, while the spine itself functions as a heat sink, maintaining stable performance [3](#ref-3).

These technical choices weave together one grand narrative. It's a story that begins with founder John Bowers' belief that "the speaker cabinet is sound's greatest enemy" [1](#ref-1). Early driver separation structures, Matrix internal reinforcement, and the innovation of back-pressure treatment in the Nautilus. The 805 D4 is the logical conclusion of over 40 years of this exploration. Each aspect of its form follows one single philosophy: to acoustically vanish the cabinet.

## **3. Sonic Landscapes, Soul's Resonance — Listening Experience Exploration**

| Reviewer / Medium | Quote Excerpt |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Alan Taffel / The Absolute Sound](https://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/bowers-wilkins-805-d4/) | "Like all the best small two-way speakers, the D4 disappears completely and throws a soundstage with uncannily tight imaging. However, unlike most of its ilk, the B&W has bass quantity and quality to kill for." |
| [What Hi-Fi?](https://www.whathifi.com/reviews/bowers-and-wilkins-805-d4-speakers) | "Outright clarity is class-leading, as is the 805 D4's ability to track the envelope of a note from its leading edge to its trailing harmonics. The speakers are as agile and articulate as they come..." |
| [Hans Wetzel / SoundStage! Ultra](https://www.soundstageultra.com/index.php/equipment-menu/1061-bowers-wilkins-805-d4-loudspeakers) | "The 805 D4 is not a neutral loudspeaker... But if you're after something altogether more vivid and exciting... then the 805 D4 may be your endgame bookshelf speaker." |
| [Naim Forum User "Hallowed_be_thy_Naim"](https://community.naimaudio.com/t/are-b-ws-a-love-hate-speaker/33842?page=2) | "The diamond tweeter is superb. High frequencies are sparkling, but not harsh. However I could see this may not appeal to all." |

### **Genre-Specific Listening Analysis**

**Classical (Orchestral):**
When playing complex orchestral pieces like Orff's "Carmina Burana," the 805 D4's true worth becomes apparent [9](#ref-9). Its acoustic landscape is so vast it completely erases any memory of the speaker's physical size. Particularly noteworthy are its astounding resolution and spatial definition capabilities. The combination of diamond tweeter agility and a cabinet with resonance suppressed to the extreme clearly separates each instrument part and delivers them to the listener without muddying. This is not mere analytical sound decomposition, but a holographic experience that reproduces the depth and breadth of space where each instrument is positioned. The expression "out-of-the-box" that many reviews point to precisely captures this sensation [9](#ref-9).

**Jazz (Vocal & Small Ensemble):**
Listening to female vocals reveals admiration for the purity of midrange that the Continuum cone brings [3](#ref-3). Voice texture and subtle nuances of breathing feel vivid, creating the illusion of singing right before you. As What Hi-Fi? described as "agile and articulate" [9](#ref-9), changes in saxophone solo microdynamics and the fading metallic resonance of cymbals are portrayed with surprising realism. The "tailored" high-frequency characteristics shown in Stereophile measurements [12](#ref-12) add distinctive "airiness" and "sparkle" here. While this can bring life-giving performance to some recordings, depending on listener preference and system, it might be perceived as slight coloration.

**EDM / Rock (Bass and Dynamics):**
In this realm where bookshelf speaker limits are questioned, the 805 D4 shows remarkable performance. The bass that The Absolute Sound praised as "to kill for" [11](#ref-11) likely results from prioritizing quality over quantity. Its essence lies in overwhelming speed and control. Electronic music's tight kick drums pierce space sharply without delay and without dragging extra resonance. However, it cannot overturn physical laws. As nominal specifications indicate, ultra-low frequencies below 42Hz (-3dB) are outside reproduction range [8](#ref-8), and to fully reproduce movie LFE or pipe organ's lowest pedal notes would still require help from quality subwoofers [3](#ref-3). What the 805 D4 chose was not pursuit of quantity, but "articulation" that accurately depicts pitch and rhythm. This is nothing other than an expression of extremely rational design philosophy as a high-end monitor.

## **4. Value Scales — Multi-faceted Evaluation**

| Evaluation Axis | Score (5-point scale) | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | ★★★★★ | A masterpiece gathering the essence of modern speaker engineering. The combination of diamond tweeter, Continuum cone, and innovative reverse-wrap/Matrix cabinet represents the pinnacle of B&W's research and development [2](#ref-2). While measurement performance isn't completely neutral, it proves exceptional control of distortion and resonance [12](#ref-12). This is the ideal form of engineering serving clear acoustic objectives. |
| **Musical Appeal** | ★★★★☆ | Provides rare immersion and thrills. Its core strengths—clarity, speed, imaging—deeply draw listeners into music [10](#ref-10). However, its "vivid" and "analytical" character [9](#ref-9) means it's not a speaker that tolerates all sources. Appeal diminishes at low volumes [9](#ref-9), and may not suit those prioritizing warmth or relaxation. Its appeal is powerful but has specific directionality. |
| **Build Quality** | ★★★★★ | Flawless. Almost all reviews describe it as "exquisite" and "beautifully made" [3](#ref-3). Use of premium materials like laminated plywood, solid aluminum, and British Connolly leather [13](#ref-13), plus automotive-grade paint finish, positions it at the pinnacle of this class. It doesn't betray expectations as a luxury product the price suggests. |
| **Price-to-Value** | ★★★☆☆ | A complex evaluation axis. The ~1.4 million yen price is a significant investment. Some reviews rate it as "relatively good value" since seeking equivalent technology and quality from boutique brands would cost twice as much [10](#ref-10). However, user forums point out that products like KEF R3 Meta provide most performance at a fraction of the price [14](#ref-14), and it competes directly with excellent floor-standers including the company's own 804 D4 [26](#ref-26). Its value varies greatly depending on how much priority is placed on this unit's unique strengths (imaging, build quality) over bass extension or neutrality. |
| **Future-proofing / Repairability** | ★★★★☆ | As a passive speaker from a major manufacturer, its basic technology won't become obsolete. The 800 Series maintains high resale value [3](#ref-3). Rear-mounted crossover also contributes to repair ease [5](#ref-5). The only concern is that its clear acoustic personality might change evaluation with audio trends, but its fundamental quality will remain unshaken. |

### **Deep Analysis Based on Objective Measurement Data**

Supporting subjective listening impressions is the cold measurement data. Detailed laboratory measurements published by Stereophile and Hi-Fi News magazines highlight the physical characteristics that constitute the 805 D4's acoustic character [12](#ref-12).

**Frequency Response and Intentional Sound Design:**
On-axis frequency response clearly shows that B&W aimed for intentionally "tailored" acoustic balance rather than pure flat response [12](#ref-12). Particularly, the high frequencies rise smoothly with frequency, forming a peak around 9-10kHz [12](#ref-12). This characteristic is the physical source of the "airiness" and "vividness" spoken of in many reviews, and represents design philosophy to maximize perceived detail [12](#ref-12). Conversely, slight suppression is seen in the midrange, which might be why some listeners perceive a "U-curve" sound [12](#ref-12).

  sourceUrl="https://www.stereophile.com/content/bowers-wilkins-805-d4-signature-loudspeaker-measurements"
/>

**Impedance and Amplifier Requirements:**
While nominal impedance is listed as 8Ω, the reality is more complex [5](#ref-5). According to Stereophile measurements, equivalent parallel resistance (EPDR) drops significantly in specific frequency bands, reaching as low as 2Ω between 8.9-10kHz [12](#ref-12). This means the 805 D4 is a "relatively current-hungry load" for amplifiers [12](#ref-12). With poor-quality amplifiers, sound may harden at high volumes, and the data suggests that stable power amplifiers with ample drive capability are essential to draw out this speaker's true potential [12](#ref-12).

  sourceUrl="https://www.stereophile.com/content/bowers-wilkins-805-d4-signature-loudspeaker-measurements"
/>

**Distortion and Resonance Suppression:**
One of this unit's most outstanding performances is its extremely low distortion rate. B&W's official specs show excellent values of less than 1% from 90Hz to 20kHz, and less than 0.3% above 120Hz [5](#ref-5). Independent measurements also show THD remaining at just 0.23% even under harsh conditions of 50Hz at 90dB, with even lower values in high frequencies [18](#ref-18). This results from the material advantages of diamond tweeter and Continuum cone, and above all, thoroughly eliminating cabinet resonance. Accelerometer measurements show cabinet resonance modes are extremely low-level and high-Q, concluding that audible impact is virtually nonexistent [12](#ref-12).

  sourceUrl="https://www.stereophile.com/content/bowers-wilkins-805-d4-signature-loudspeaker-measurements"
/>

**Time Domain Response (CSD/Waterfall):**
The cumulative spectral decay (waterfall) plot tells how clean the 805 D4's time domain response is [12](#ref-12). The plot shows virtually no unwanted energy (ringing) remains after input signal stops, directly relating to sound attack and decay speed, and depth of silence between notes. While slight delayed energy possibly attributable to cone termination treatment is visible around 1.4kHz, overall it's rated as "superbly clean," forming the basis for its clear and agile sound quality [12](#ref-12).

/>

Overall, measurement data acknowledges that the 805 D4 is not a "textbook neutral" speaker, while proving it's at the highest level of modern speaker engineering in fundamental performance like distortion, resonance, and time domain response. Its acoustic personality is not accidental but the crystallization of highly advanced engineering designed with clear intent.

### **Positive/Negative Elements Re-examined: The Duality of "Clarity" and "Brightness"**

Deep analysis of evaluations surrounding the 805 D4 reveals an interesting duality. That is, the evaluation of high-frequency expression as "Clarity" versus "Brightness" – two sides of the same coin.

Professional magazine reviews praise its high frequencies with words like "resolution," "sparkle," and "airiness" [9](#ref-9). Conversely, user forums and communities emphasizing objective measurements show critical opinions like "bright," "hot," and "fatiguing" [14](#ref-14). Where does this discrepancy come from?

The key to the answer lies in Stereophile's measurement data [12](#ref-12). The data clearly shows intentionally "tailored" high-frequency characteristics with a peak from 9-10kHz. This is nothing other than physical evidence supporting both subjective evaluations. This high-frequency lift changes its character depending on circumstances. When reproduced in acoustically prepared listening rooms with high-quality recordings, probably through slightly warm-leaning high-end equipment, it would be perceived as astonishing "clarity" and "detail." This might be one factor why reviews using manufacturer-provided samples tend toward positive evaluation.

However, in typical home environments, playing diverse quality recordings through neutral or bright-leaning equipment, the same characteristic might exceed tolerance and be felt as "brightness" or "harshness."

In conclusion, the 805 D4's most controversial characteristic is not a flaw but an expression of intentional design philosophy. It is designed pursuing maximum perceptual resolution. This single acoustic feature can become either the greatest virtue or the greatest challenge, depending on system context and listener sensibility. Understanding this point is the first step toward correctly evaluating the 805 D4.

## **5. Currents of the Times and Existence Significance — 805 D4's Position**

### **Leap from 805 D3**

The evolution from D3 to D4 is not mere minor change. As mentioned above, adopting reverse-wrap cabinet construction is a fundamental transformation that for the first time placed the 805 structurally on complete equal footing with other 800 Series [13](#ref-13). Acoustically, the D4 generation is often described as warmer, more natural, and with reduced "hotness" in upper-midrange compared to D3 generation [29](#ref-29). This suggests B&W is consciously evolving their house sound toward a more refined, less fatiguing direction [19](#ref-19).

### **Stand-mount vs Floor-standing (vs 804 D4)**

The 805 D4's price approaches that of its bigger brother, the floor-standing 804 D4 [26](#ref-26). This forces a kind of philosophical choice for potential buyers.

* **Reasons to Choose 805 D4:** It's a philosophy seeking the ultimate in the two-way point-source monitor format. It has potential to provide exceptional soundstage positioning and "speaker disappearing" sensation difficult to achieve with larger, more complex multi-driver systems [10](#ref-10). A choice for purists prioritizing sound coherence and precise spatial portrayal above all else.
* **Reasons to Choose 804 D4:** This features three-way design with two dedicated bass drivers and dedicated midrange cone [5](#ref-5). It means greater scale sense, power, and much deeper bass extension. Dedicated midrange may bring greater accuracy in voice and instrument reproduction [5](#ref-5). A more practical and versatile choice for larger rooms or listeners seeking full-range sound without subwoofers.

This either-or choice highlights the 805 D4's very reason for existence. The 805 D4 is not simply the "entry model" of the 800 Series. It is B&W's "statement" of what's possible within stand-mount physical constraints. It exists to answer specific audiophile demands seeking uncompromising quality in compact form. Its reason for being is explained solely by acoustic ambition, not market segmentation.

### **Crossroads of Acoustic Philosophy: Listening Comparisons with Competitors**

To understand the 805 D4's true value, dialogue with other philosophical giants existing in the same price range is indispensable. These competitors, each espousing different acoustic philosophies, become mirrors that clearly illuminate the path the 805 D4 has chosen.

**vs KEF Reference 1 Meta: Dialogue with Scientific Fidelity**
KEF pursues measurement fidelity and point-source ideals with their Uni-Q coaxial driver and MAT (Metamaterial Absorption Technology) [32](#ref-32). Their sound is described by many audiophiles as "neutral" and "accurate" [34](#ref-34). In contrast, the 805 D4 features "vividness" and "airiness" brought by intentionally tailored high-frequency characteristics [13](#ref-13). This manifests B&W's "house sound" and the exciting sound design sometimes described as "U-curve" [34](#ref-34). What Hi-Fi? magazine points out that KEF Reference 1 Meta has deeper, more authoritative bass reproduction capability than the 805 D4, so KEF might have advantage for those emphasizing physical aspects [9](#ref-9). The choice ultimately comes down to a philosophical question: seeking pure scientific reproduction or entrusting oneself to B&W's presented artistic interpretation.

**vs Magico A1: Sound from Absolute Silence**
Magico A1 takes a completely different approach with sealed enclosures made from aircraft-grade aluminum [24](#ref-24). This is a choice that cleanly abandons port-assisted bass reinforcement to gain transient accuracy and installation tolerance [24](#ref-24). Its sound is described as "balanced and insightful," emphasizing presenting recorded signals as they are without exaggeration [36](#ref-36). This contrasts with the 805 D4's sound design "for thrills" [13](#ref-13). One reviewer comparing high-end B&W and Magico felt both were "not on the same playing field," suggesting Magico aims for a more neutral and refined acoustic world [37](#ref-37). If the 805 D4 is a painter depicting drama through light and shadow contrast, Magico A1 might be a photographer quietly capturing the subject's essence.

**vs Sonus Faber Guarneri G5: Speaker as Instrument**
Italy's treasure, Sonus Faber, true to its name, views speakers not as mere reproduction devices but as "instruments" that themselves make music [39](#ref-39). Guarneri G5 is known for spinning out "warm," "rich," and "musical" tones from its lute-shaped cabinet and traditional material choices [40](#ref-40). This is the exact opposite appeal from the 805 D4's analytical and cool clarity. One reviewer praises Sonus Faber's "amazing richness" in midrange and "holographic soundstage" while describing B&W as having "powerful, punchy, bright highs" [42](#ref-42). Guarneri G5 appeals to listeners wanting to immerse in music and soak in its emotional aspects. In contrast, the 805 D4 unravels music's very structure, illuminating its intellectual aspects. Both aim for the summit, but their climbing routes are completely different.

### **Off-axis Characteristics and Spatial Acoustics — Insights from Measurement Data**

Speaker true value is greatly influenced not only by sound reaching the listening position directly (on-axis characteristics) but also by sound reflected off walls, ceiling, and floor reaching the ear (off-axis characteristics). Detailed measurement data provided by publications like Stereophile scientifically reveals how the 805 D4 behaves in the real space called a listening room [12](#ref-12).

First, the 805 D4's horizontal sound spread (horizontal directivity) is shown to be very well controlled [12](#ref-12). From midrange to mid-high frequencies, frequency response disruption is minimal even off-axis, an essential element for forming accurate and stable stereo imaging [12](#ref-12). This characteristic means first reflection sound from side walls has similar timbre to direct sound, extremely important for enhancing overall acoustic harmony of the space [43](#ref-43).

Conversely, vertical directivity is more limited [12](#ref-12). Measurement data shows that deviating more than 5 degrees above or below the tweeter axis causes characteristic changes around crossover frequency [12](#ref-12). This suggests the importance of precisely matching listener ear height to tweeter height, representing a setup requirement to maximize this speaker's performance.

B&W's iconic "tweeter-on-top" design is greatly involved in this directional characteristic. Some measurement-focused communities hold critical views that this design, lacking a baffle, goes against directivity control through waveguides mainstream in modern speaker design, spreading high frequencies too widely [44](#ref-44). However, this wide dispersion is one factor creating B&W's distinctive "airiness" and "openness," the result of intended acoustic design. And this characteristic leaves room for user adjustment. Since directivity narrows around the on-axis high-frequency peak, adjusting speaker "toe-in" (inward angle) can effectively control the amount of high-frequency energy reaching the listening position [12](#ref-12).

In conclusion, the 805 D4 is not a speaker with perfectly flat characteristics in measurement data. However, its off-axis characteristics, particularly well-behaved horizontal behavior, tell of high design maturity. Its acoustic personality is the product of intentional design philosophy, and by pursuing setup – particularly listening height and toe-in angle – its true worth can be unleashed in the listening room.

## **6. Conclusion & Recommended Users**

### **People We Would Recommend This Speaker To**

* **Analytical Listeners:** Audiophiles prioritizing detail, resolution, and transparency above all, wanting to listen into every corner of recordings [9](#ref-9).
* **Imaging Seekers:** Listeners who value holographic 3D soundstages and complete speaker disappearance above all else [10](#ref-10).
* **Quality and Aesthetics Appreciators:** Individuals who value the highest build quality, materials, and industrial design, and don't mind paying the price [3](#ref-3).
* **Small-to-Medium Room Users:** In spaces where large floor-standers would be overwhelming, this form factor and bass output are ideal [3](#ref-3).

### **People Who Should Avoid This Speaker**

* **"Warmth" Priority Listeners:** Those preferring rich, forgiving, relaxed tonality. The 805 D4's personality is vivid and stimulating, not warm and comfortable [13](#ref-13).
* **Bright Peripheral Equipment Owners:** Combining with already bright-leaning components could easily result in fatiguing sound [14](#ref-14). Careful matching with neutral to warm equipment is essential.
* **Low-Volume Listeners:** This speaker shows its true worth only when given adequate volume, and may feel lifeless at extremely low volumes [9](#ref-9).
* **Bass Enthusiasts (without subwoofer):** While having excellent bass beyond its size, those seeking the deepest electronic music or movie impact will need to budget for high-quality subwoofer addition [3](#ref-3).

### **Future-proofing**

As a high-quality passive speaker, it's possible to further draw out its performance through amplifier and source equipment upgrades. Aftermarket modifications don't suit products of this class. Its value lies in the perfect state completed at the factory.

### **Overall Rating: ★★★★☆ (4.5/5)**

Technically excellent and musically thrilling, representing one pinnacle of stand-mount speakers. It has established new standards in clarity and build quality. However, it's not a universal speaker but a specialized instrument with clear personality. Its distinctive acoustic character and pricing prevent universal recommendation to everyone. Therefore, while not reaching full marks, it shows near-perfect achievement in its intended purpose.
