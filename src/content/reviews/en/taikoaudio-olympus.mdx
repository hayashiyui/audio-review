## **Chapter 1: A New Philosophy of Digital Audio**

### **Introduction**

The Olympus music server from Netherlands-based Taiko Audio is not merely a product upgrade. It represents the culmination of an ambitious endeavor to fundamentally question and redefine the very nature of digital sources. Positioned above the company's already highly-regarded flagship Extreme server, Olympus stands at the pinnacle of contemporary high-end audio in its design philosophy, physical construction, and price point [1](#ref1).

As Taiko Audio itself describes, what Olympus delivers is a "completely different musical experience" that transcends traditional audiophile vocabulary—soundstage, dynamics, timbre—terms that simply cannot capture its essence [4](#ref4). Its goal is to approach as closely as possible the performance itself, whether intended or unintended by the recording engineer.

### **The "Subtractive" Philosophy**

The core philosophy that permeates Olympus's design is not "addition" but "reduction" [7](#ref7).

This is the idea of thoroughly eliminating every source of noise and distortion that intervenes between listener and musical data—whether electrical, mechanical, or temporal. Under this philosophy, any intermediate processing or conversion, however minute, leaves unwanted sonic traces [1](#ref1). What Taiko Audio aims for is the methodical, relentless removal of every element that could potentially degrade sound quality: AC power-derived noise, electrical and mechanical vibrations generated by internal components, unnecessary software processes, and data transfer protocol overhead [2](#ref2). The resulting sound is neither "digital" nor "analog," but simply transparent—a window to the recording itself [1](#ref1).

### **The Olympus Ecosystem and Investment**

Olympus is not a single component but an ecosystem with modular expandability. Its pricing structure clearly indicates this product belongs to the category known as "Summit-Fi."

**Table 1: Configuration and Pricing (MSRP, excluding VAT)**

| Configuration | Price | Included/Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Taiko Audio Olympus Server XDMI** | \$95,000 | XDMI output, DAC output, USB output, SFP+ network card, 3.84TB storage, flight case |
| **Taiko Audio Olympus I/O XDMI** (addition to Olympus) | \$32,000 | Interface card, QSFP-DD interconnect cable, second flight case |
| **Olympus I/O XDMI** (addition to Extreme) | \$53,000 | Upgrades existing Extreme server |

This pricing provides crucial context for understanding the technical details and sonic evaluations that follow within its realistic market positioning.

### **Philosophy-Driven Design Unity**

Taiko's "subtractive" philosophy is not mere marketing speak. It is a fundamental technical directive that explains every major design decision, from the massive chassis to battery power supplies to the controversial XDMI interface. This philosophy even provides a compelling explanation for the seemingly counterintuitive "resolution paradox" phenomenon.

Let us unpack this logic. First, observing Olympus's design elements reveals a consistent pattern. The massive chassis "reduces" mechanical vibration and RFI/EMI [7](#ref7). Battery power "reduces" AC power noise and ground loops [8](#ref8). The thoroughly lightened OS "reduces" software processing-derived noise [12](#ref12). And the XDMI interface "reduces" protocol conversion overhead [8](#ref8). All of these are clearly "subtractive" approaches.

If this philosophy is absolute, then any "additive" process should degrade sound quality. This hypothesis is tested by the "resolution paradox" reported in user reviews [11](#ref11). According to reviews, higher-resolution playback and upsampling requiring more CPU processing power can sometimes "collapse" sound quality. This processing is unmistakably an "additive" step, increasing power consumption and thus electrical noise [12](#ref12).

In conclusion, this paradox is not a flaw but rather proof of the ultimate validity of the "subtractive" philosophy. Olympus is so transparent that it exposes even the noise floor generated by its own internal processing—noise that would be masked by the higher inherent noise floor of lesser-performing components. This fact shifts the focus from "which resolution is best?" to "which playback method generates the least processing noise?" Olympus confronts us with the uncomfortable truth that what we have long considered "improvements" in digital audio (such as upsampling) are also acts of noise "addition."

## **Chapter 2: Engineering from Solid Block: Physical and Mechanical Integrity**

### **Monumental Chassis**

Olympus's physical presence is overwhelming. The main chassis is CNC-machined from a 72kg aerospace-grade aluminum ingot [7](#ref7). This is not mere aesthetic luxury. This enormous mass functions as an inert platform for absorbing and damping vibration, while simultaneously serving as a robust shield against external RFI (radio frequency interference) and EMI (electromagnetic interference).

### **Strategic Materials Science**

The approach to controlling vibration and resonance employs not a single material but a combination of multiple materials. The chassis features a hybrid copper-aluminum construction [14](#ref14). Copper is used liberally to shield individual internal modules and efficiently dissipate heat as a heat sink [12](#ref12). Additionally, strategic points incorporate a special resin-impregnated plywood called "Panzerholz," known for its excellent damping characteristics and benign vibrational spectrum [10](#ref10).

### **Convection Cooling and Thermal Management**

Olympus employs a completely passive cooling system that uses no cooling fans, which would be sources of noise. Heat generated by processors is efficiently dissipated into the atmosphere through coolant circulating in copper pipes and the chassis [12](#ref12). This design results in completely silent operation. Since the chassis is designed assuming free ambient air flow, use in enclosed racks or on carpeting should be avoided [16](#ref16). Proper thermal management is essential for maintaining performance, with CPU operating temperatures maintained between 35°C and 50°C depending on environment and load [17](#ref17).

### **Two-Box Solution: Olympus I/O**

In pursuit of ultimate performance, the optional Olympus I/O chassis plays a crucial role. This is not merely an add-on but the ultimate expression of the design philosophy. Its primary purpose is to physically separate the noisiest components (network card) from the most sensitive components (audio output card) from the main server chassis [8](#ref8).

This separation provides superior electrical isolation, thermal management, and vibration control for these critical cards [18](#ref18). The connection between server and I/O units uses not standard cables but a proprietary QSFP-DD (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Double Density) interconnect system designed to further enhance performance [12](#ref12).

### **Mass as Message**

The total weight—60kg for the Olympus server alone, reaching 100kg when combined with the I/O unit—is the physical manifestation of the "subtractive" philosophy. Some critics might view this as "excessive specification to justify high prices" [15](#ref15). However, following the engineering logic reveals this mass as a non-negotiable requirement for creating a mechanically and electrically quiet foundation upon which all other system performance is built.

The rationale lies in Taiko Audio's clear connection between chassis design and performance objectives. Vibration control and RFI/EMI shielding are the primary purposes [10](#ref10). The 6,000 holes in the previous Extreme model's top plate were designed as "waveguides" to attenuate radiated noise by 81dB (approximately 1/10,000) [10](#ref10), and this continues to be employed in Olympus. In the extreme audio world, mechanical resonance and airborne/structure-borne vibration are considered significant sources of minute distortions that mask detail and blur imaging. A massive, inert, and properly damped chassis is the first line of defense against these noises.

Therefore, this weight is not an arbitrary choice but a direct consequence of the "no-compromise" approach. It was determined necessary to start with a 72kg aluminum ingot to achieve the desired level of mechanical and electrical silence. Weight is not the function but the result derived from the primary design goal of "reducing" environmental noise.

## **Chapter 3: Power and Data: Reinvention from Zero**

### **3.1 Battery Power Supply (BPS): Foundation of Silence**

At the heart of the Olympus platform lie multiple independent Battery Power Supply (BPS) systems [2](#ref2). The server itself incorporates two BPS units, one linear power supply, and two charging power supplies [2](#ref2). Adding the Olympus I/O unit introduces two additional dedicated BPS units for the network card and audio output card respectively [2](#ref2). This thorough separation is designed to eliminate cross-interference between components.

The batteries employed are far from ordinary. They feature a specialized lithium titanate oxide (LTO) chemistry characterized by safety, 30+ year longevity, and extremely low output impedance [8](#ref8). This low impedance enables instantaneous delivery of massive peak currents up to 2,000A, far exceeding existing power supplies to achieve unparalleled dynamics [8](#ref8).

Throughout the system, fast GaN (gallium nitride) FET-based power circuits are employed, and buffering eliminates electrolytic capacitors that could adversely affect sound quality, using only film capacitors to preserve signal purity [8](#ref8). Furthermore, the entire system electrically "floats" from the AC line, eliminating ground loops—audio's nemesis—and providing complete liberation from AC power-derived noise [8](#ref8).

Battery charging cycles can be managed and configured via a dedicated BMS (Battery Management System) app through Bluetooth [7](#ref7). For optimal performance, operation should be avoided when system voltage drops below specific thresholds (14V for system batteries, 12V for XDMI batteries) [16](#ref16).

### **3.2 XDMI Interface: Direct Path to DAC**

Taiko Audio views conventional digital interfaces like USB and AES/EBU as performance bottlenecks.

These interfaces require multiple data conversions that introduce latency and degrade sound quality [6](#ref6).

Taiko's answer to this problem is XDMI (Extreme Direct Music Interface). This is a proprietary hardware and software solution designed from scratch to establish a direct, ultra-high-speed data path from CPU to output stage [2](#ref2).

XDMI is a PCIe 5.0 bus-based system comprising a baseboard, interchangeable daughter boards corresponding to specific outputs (AES/EBU, RCA, or direct links to specific DACs like MSB and Lampizator), and a proprietary QSFP interconnect system for connecting external I/O boxes [8](#ref8). This architecture achieves astounding throughput 250 to 2,000 times greater than typical USB interfaces [8](#ref8).

Even more innovative is the claim of "clockless" design. Taiko states that their proprietary "Secret Taiko Solution" technology eliminates the need for the four clocks typically present in the path to the DAC. This aims to liberate from the sonic coloration inherent to clocks [8](#ref8).

### **3.3 Computational Core: The "Anti-Computer" Computer**

How dramatically Olympus has leaped from its predecessor Extreme is evident in the comparison of computational processing power.

**Table 2: Technical Specifications Comparison: Olympus vs. Extreme**

| Feature | Taiko SGM Extreme | Taiko Olympus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Processor** | 2x Intel Xeon Scalable (total 20 physical cores) | AMD Threadripper 24-core |
| **Memory** | 48GB DDR4-2400 | 64GB DDR5 |
| **Interface** | PCIe Gen 3 | PCIe Gen 5 |
| **Storage Bus** | PCIe Gen 3 M.2 | PCIe Gen 5 MCIO U.2/U.3 |
| **OS** | Windows 10 (heavily lightened) | Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC (heavily lightened) |

This overwhelming computational power exists not for advanced DSP processing but for precisely the opposite purpose. The software environment employs a specially configured Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC with unnecessary services and processes stripped to the absolute minimum. Taiko's assertion is that prioritizing sound quality over convenience and lightening Windows to its core components achieves the best sound quality [13](#ref13). Initial operation is primarily Roon-based, with future support for proprietary playback software XDMS planned [3](#ref3).

### **New Metrics for Digital Performance**

Olympus's architecture—particularly BPS and XDMI—suggests a potential shift away from the single metric long emphasized in digital audio: "jitter values (ps)" toward different evaluation axes.

First, let us clarify which "jitter" we are discussing. What is commonly displayed in catalogs is typically interface jitter in outputs like SPDIF, or jitter derived from the phase noise spectrum of DAC internal clocks measured under strictly controlled environments. The short-term stability and close-in phase noise that audio clock manufacturers proudly display are also important figures indicating the static, frequency-domain performance of oscillators alone. However, this paper focuses on the more dynamic and complex phase fluctuations that actually occur during playback when CPU processing loads and power line fluctuations affect clock systems. This realm lacks standardized measurement methods and is unsuitable for numerical comparison under fixed conditions. In other words, no matter how excellent a clock unit may be, if system load variations and power noise are significant, "actual use" fluctuations may increase. What Taiko appears to emphasize is this "behavior under operation," which differs in focus from the "idling quietness" shown by clock manufacturers, though they are not unrelated but rather complementary.

So what serves as our guide? Combining Taiko's design philosophy with user reports reveals latency and real-time power consumption behavior—particularly the minimization and stability of instantaneous load variations. Latency is not merely delay amount but is inextricably linked to processing stability and low overhead, while power consumption is more about instantaneous spikes and fluctuation ranges rather than average values. Such instantaneous variations can inject noise into power lines, potentially worsening clock phase noise. Therefore, a hypothesis emerges of reading latency and power consumption behavior as proxy indicators of "processing-derived noise."

The logic supporting this hypothesis is straightforward. Rather than presenting absolute jitter values, Taiko appears to emphasize latency reduction and load stabilization, which they consider more significant for sound quality. Multiple users report experiencing sound quality improvements when system power consumption during playback is low and fluctuations are minimal. Since jitter is a form of temporal error that increases when power noise and processing load fluctuations affect clocks, suppressing these root causes may push jitter to sufficiently low levels. "Jitter improvement" here means not dramatic changes in the ps values typically found in catalogs, but rather reduction in dynamic fluctuations that can occur during actual operation. In other words, jitter improved through latency and noise reduction can be considered a "different type of jitter" with different measurement targets and interpretations from commonly published figures.

From this perspective, the roles of BPS and XDMI become clear. BPS (Battery Power Supply) provides extremely clean and stable power, smoothing instantaneous current spikes to suppress power line-derived noise injection. XDMI secures wideband, direct data paths, minimizing CPU processing waits and software stack overhead to contribute to latency homogenization and processing load leveling. While the adoption of powerful CPUs might seem contradictory to low-noise orientation, the logic holds if computational headroom is secured while BPS absorbs load variations, ultimately suppressing substantial processing noise.

What emerges is the hypothesis that significantly suppressing processing-derived noise (components estimable from instantaneous power consumption variations) and processing latency inherently weakens some conditions that generate significant jitter, making jitter itself no longer the dominant factor determining system performance. The key lies in establishing verification methods: how to measure correlations between instantaneous power waveforms and phase noise spectra, how to quantify latency distribution (maximum, minimum, standard deviation) and link it to sound quality evaluation. Work to separate relationships with interface jitter values and DAC internal jitter values is also unavoidable.

In essence, the important question is not just "how many picoseconds is the jitter?" but "how low and stable is processing-derived noise?" and "how homogenized is latency?"—perspectives that may hold greater significance in future digital source evaluation. The evaluation focus expands from the final clock stage alone to the entire pipeline from data generation to transfer—that is the paradigm shift Olympus presents.

## **Chapter 4: Listening Sessions: Approaching the Original Event**

### **Sound Character: Beyond "Digital" and "Analog"**

Integrating listening impressions from multiple reviews reveals a consistent theme: Olympus's sound transcends conventional descriptors [4](#ref4).

* **Purity and Transparency:** Its sound is characterized by "an ultra-wideband, impeccably defined frequency spectrum without any grain, smear, or distortion" [8](#ref8). The noise floor drops to imperceptible levels, functioning as an "incredibly transparent" device [12](#ref12).
* **Resolution and Delicacy:** "Incredibly nuanced and microscopic" yet "fluid, colorful, delicate, and extremely musical" [7](#ref7). It possesses astounding resolution that can track individual grains of sand in a shaker while never becoming analytical or harsh [7](#ref7).
* **Dynamics and Control:** Bass is described as "deep, controlled, tight, and full" [7](#ref7). Battery power provides dynamics "exceeding any linear power supply" [8](#ref8).
* **Realism and Presence:** The overall effect brings a sense of approaching "the recording engineer's true intent" [1](#ref1). It creates an "interactive, palpable auditory and physical atmosphere" [8](#ref8), sometimes generating goosebumps not from the music itself but from the astounding separation and reality of sound [7](#ref7).

### **The Resolution Paradox in Practice**

During auditioning with the built-in XDMI DAC, the trade-off between file resolution and sound quality proved the most fascinating and revealing discovery.

The experience of playing standard CD-quality Redbook (16bit/44.1kHz) was truly "breathtaking" and a "mental shock" that overturned conventional wisdom [11](#ref11). Its sound quality far exceeded expectations and even seemed superior to upsampled high-resolution sources.

Conversely, playing ultra-high-resolution files like DSD512 could paradoxically result in the "worst" sound quality. This occurs because high processing loads increase power consumption, consequently increasing internal noise [11](#ref11).

For many recordings, the "sweet spot" for optimal sound quality existed at relatively low resolutions: 1fs (44.1/48kHz) or 2fs (88.2/96kHz) for PCM, and DSD64 for DSD [11](#ref11). This audibly confirms the aforementioned "subtractive" philosophy—that "adding" processing leads to "adding" noise.

※It is suggested that this phenomenon does not occur with XDMI digital output and may be attributed to increased power consumption of the built-in DAC chip.

### **Optimization for Peak Performance**

Extracting Olympus's full potential requires several careful setup considerations:

* Physically removing the built-in music storage drive and using streaming services or NAS (Network Attached Storage) eliminates the drive's constant power consumption, improving sound quality [11](#ref11).
* When using XDMI output, simply physically disconnecting USB cables produces audible improvements [11](#ref11).
* Since Olympus fundamentally changes the system's reference point, all existing accessories and adjustments—footers, cables—must be re-evaluated from zero without preconceptions [24](#ref24).

## **Chapter 5: View from the Summit: Comparative Analysis**

### **Introduction**

When considering products in this price range, understanding the "character" of top contenders is extremely important, as no absolute "best" exists—system compatibility and personal preferences ultimately determine the final judgment. This section integrates comparisons from users and reviewers to clarify Olympus's position.

### **Table 3: Sound Quality Character Comparison of Major Servers**

| Server | Primary Sound Characteristics | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Taiko Olympus** | Purity, transparency, ultimate resolution, vast soundstage, vanishing noise floor. Neither "digital" nor "analog" but "real." Close to recording engineer's intent. | 1 |
| **Taiko Extreme** | (Olympus reference point) Powerful, dynamic, detail-rich. Inferior to Olympus in completeness and transparency. | 1 |
| **Aurender W20SE** | Smooth, refined, fluid, excellent tonal suppleness. "LP-like soft sound" with "finesse" and "ambience." May lack dynamics compared to competitors. | 26 |
| **Innuos Statement** | Organic, smooth, "analog-like." Less "digital smell." Positioned between Taiko's clinical accuracy and other products' warmth. | 31 |
| **Wadax Atlantis Ref.** | Natural, dynamic, "alive." Warm, analog-like with "boomy bass." Comparable to the best vinyl reproduction, fundamentally changing digital playback possibilities. | 34 |

### **Detailed Comparisons**

* **Olympus vs. Extreme:** Olympus represents not incremental improvement from Extreme but a fundamental leap. One user rated Extreme as "100%" while Olympus achieved "approximately 300%" performance [1](#ref1). Superior in every conceivable area—transparency, soundstage, realism—without trade-offs [4](#ref4).
* **Extreme vs. Aurender W20SE:** A Korean group listening session concluded that Taiko Extreme exceeded Aurender W20SE "in almost all aspects," particularly in musical nuance, dimensionality, and depth expression [26](#ref26). While W20SE was characterized as having a smoother, LP-like sound character [27](#ref27), Taiko was considered more transparent and detail-oriented.
* **Extreme vs. Innuos Statement:** Users describe Statement as very "organic" and "analog-like" [32](#ref32). A user who auditioned both stated that Taiko Extreme provided a "completely different listening experience" from Statement, with a "large gap" between them [31](#ref31). Another characterized Taiko as "clinical and accurate" and Innuos as "intermediate" [33](#ref33).
* **Extreme vs. Wadax Atlantis Reference:** This is truly a battle of titans. Both are considered entities that redefine digital audio [34](#ref34). In one user comparison, Wadax was characterized as having "warm, analog-like sound with boomy bass" while Taiko showed superiority in "transparency, spaciousness, dark background, detail and decay" [37](#ref37). Interestingly, optimal sound quality was reportedly achieved by combining both units—specifically using Wadax as Roon Core and Taiko as Renderer/Endpoint, suggesting they may have different strengths in different parts of the processing chain [37](#ref37).

## **Chapter 6: Integration and Conclusion: Redefining Digital Sources**

### **Addressing Skepticism**

The "bits are bits" argument and controversies surrounding six-figure digital sources cannot be ignored [4](#ref4). Olympus responds to this skepticism through its uncompromising engineering. Its core argument is that digital audio is inherently vulnerable to analog domain issues—noise, vibration, timing instabilities—and solving these problems requires extreme engineering regardless of cost. As multiple sources indicate, the resulting audible improvements are not subtle but transformational [8](#ref8).

### **Olympus as Paradigm Shift**

Through its comprehensive "subtractive" philosophy and innovative BPS and XDMI technologies, Olympus presents more than just a new flagship product. It challenges fundamental assumptions about digital audio design, shifting evaluation focus from jitter reduction in DACs to noise elimination throughout the entire chain, proposing new metrics for performance evaluation (power consumption, latency).

### **Final Verdict**

The Taiko Audio Olympus is a monumental achievement in digital audio engineering. Its price places it in the most rarefied realm accessible only to a very limited number of audiophiles. However, for those with the means and passion to build systems capable of unleashing its potential, Olympus provides a listening experience that approaches the "unaltered bit" and the soul of original performances closer than perhaps any previous digital source. It stands as powerful testimony to the philosophy that in the pursuit of perfection, no detail is too small and no compromise acceptable.
