American company Audeze has built an absolute position in the world of planar magnetic headphones. Their clear intent to challenge yet another summit—electrostatic technology—was demonstrated with the original "CRBN." Now, the successor "CRBN2" has arrived, further refining that philosophy and technology. This is not merely a model change. Armed with carbon nanotube technology from the unusual origins of medical MRI research laboratories and the new "SLAM" technology that fundamentally overturns the bass reproduction capabilities previously considered a weakness of electrostatics, Audeze throws down the gauntlet to challenge the existing hierarchy of electrostatic headphones.

This model is Audeze's answer to the long-standing audio industry challenge: how to achieve both the powerful, physical sound character of planar magnetic drivers and the ultra-fast response and transparency that electrostatics pride themselves on. This review will thoroughly reveal that the CRBN2 is not merely a high-performance headphone but a strategic product attempting to "redefine electrostatics" in the high-end audio market, through its technical background, acoustic characteristics, and positioning in the competitive marketplace.

**Summary:**
Aggregating over 10 sources surveyed, evaluation of the CRBN2 is overwhelmingly positive. Particularly, the quality and quantity of bass that overturns electrostatic conventions, luxurious build quality, and improved comfort from the original are consistently highly rated. However, its unique tuning has drawn some questions from a minority of users, especially those favoring traditional electrostatic sound, regarding changes from the original model. Overall, the CRBN2 is accepted as a groundbreaking product presenting new possibilities for electrostatic headphones, but its sound character is not universally appealing and is positioned as a flagship with clear personality.

## **2. Technical Background: Innovation Born in MRI Laboratories**

To understand the CRBN2's acoustic performance, we must deeply examine its unusual development history and the two core technologies crystallized within it: Carbon Nanotube (CNT) drivers and SLAM Technology.

### **Breakthrough Born from MRI Laboratory Collaboration**

The technical foundation of the CRBN2 was not created for audiophiles but to meet the harsh demands of medical environments [7](#ref-7). Audeze collaborated with UCLA's neuroscience institute to develop headphones usable within MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) equipment [10](#ref-10). MRI environments present special challenges with noise reaching up to 120dB and powerful magnetic fields hostile to all electronic equipment [10](#ref-10).

This project became the direct trigger for creating CRBN's core technology. Traditional electrostatic headphone diaphragms typically used metal coatings on ultra-thin films to ensure conductivity. However, MRI environments absolutely prohibit the use of ferromagnetic metals. This constraint forced Audeze into an entirely new approach. The solution was "carbon nanotube infusion technology" that gives the diaphragm itself conductivity without relying on metal coating [7](#ref-7). By directly dispersing conductive carbon nanotubes within polymer film material, they succeeded in maintaining uniform charge across the entire diaphragm while remaining non-magnetic.

This medical technology development unexpectedly brought benefits for audiophiles. Since charge is distributed uniformly throughout the internal structure rather than surface coating, driving force becomes extremely uniform, fundamentally reducing partial vibration and distortion [8](#ref-8). Furthermore, eliminating the coating layer makes the diaphragm lighter and more efficient while improving durability, discovering numerous secondary benefits for acoustic performance.

### **Second-Generation Carbon Nanotube Driver**

The CRBN2 features a refined second-generation driver further advancing this innovative technology [3](#ref-3). The large 120mm x 90mm diaphragm has Audeze's unique structure with carbon nanotubes infused within ultra-thin polyimide film [6](#ref-6). This achieves both the ultimate low mass required for electrostatic drivers and uniform driving force like planar magnetic drivers, realizing extremely low distortion rates (under 0.1% at 90dB SPL) and wide frequency response (10Hz - 40kHz) [6](#ref-6).

### **SLAM Technology: Revolution in Electrostatic Bass**

The greatest technological innovation distinguishing the CRBN2 from the original and other electrostatic headphones is the patent-pending "SLAM (Symmetric Linear Acoustic Modulator)" technology [12](#ref-12). This is not a simple mechanism like bass reflex ports.

SLAM is a passive (non-powered) system featuring multiple precisely designed acoustic channels within golden rings positioned around the driver units [3](#ref-3). These channels actively adjust acoustic impedance in the space between ear pads and drivers, optimizing pressure within ear cups. The result is successfully boosting low-frequency response below 100Hz by up to 6dB compared to the original CRBN without increasing distortion [3](#ref-3).

This technology can be seen as Audeze's strategic move in the electrostatic market. Traditional electrostatic headphones have been weak at powerful bass reproduction due to their lightweight diaphragms being susceptible to air damping. This image of being "light but lacking impact" attracted some audiophiles while being avoided by those accustomed to the powerful sound of planar magnetic and dynamic types. SLAM Technology is Audeze's clear answer to this long-standing challenge. Rather than imitating traditional electrostatic sound represented by STAX, they chose to transplant their house sound of "powerful, voluminous bass" developed with planar magnetics onto an electrostatic platform. This makes the CRBN2 a product with hybrid appeal to not only traditional electrostatic fans but a broader range of audiophiles.

### **Flagship Electrostatic Headphone Specification Comparison**

## **3. Objective Analysis Based on Measurement Data**

Currently, detailed measurement data for the CRBN2 from reliable third-party institutions like Audio Science Review or SoundStage! Solo has not been published. However, by analyzing measurement data from its predecessor, the original CRBN, we can deeply understand the CRBN2's technical foundation and acoustic design philosophy [31](#ref-31).

### **Frequency Response**

The original CRBN already boasted exceptionally flat and extended low-frequency characteristics for an electrostatic. According to Audeze's measurements published in Positive Feedback magazine, its bass extended smoothly to 20Hz, achieving completely flat response to 300Hz with minimal EQ [31](#ref-31). Particularly noteworthy was the left-right channel matching precision, showing remarkable consistency under 1dB across the entire range in actual measurements. This forms the foundation for stable, unwavering stereo imaging [31](#ref-31). The CRBN2 can be seen as building upon this excellent low-frequency performance foundation, adding further volume and impact through SLAM Technology. The specification extension from the original's 20Hz to 10Hz also supports this evolution [6](#ref-6).

  sourceTitle="Audeze CRBN Frequency Response vs Harman Curve - Positive Feedback"
/>

### **Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)**

Most important in discussing CRBN2's sound quality is its astonishing low-distortion characteristics. Even with the original CRBN, its total harmonic distortion (THD) was praised as "unprecedented achievement." At practical 80dB SPL levels, it achieved under 1% above 30Hz, under 0.5% above 80Hz, and under 0.2% in most frequency ranges—levels difficult for magnetic drive types to achieve, especially in bass regions [31](#ref-31). This characteristic provides the technical foundation for the CRBN series' "transparency," "clarity," and "effortless detail reproduction capability" [31](#ref-31). SLAM Technology's ability to boost bass without increasing distortion is only possible because of this inherently extremely low-distortion platform. Since distortion doesn't increase even at high volumes, SLAM's powerful bass is perceived as extremely clean "high-resolution bass" without distortion-induced muddiness or bloat [31](#ref-31).

  sourceUrl="https://positive-feedback.com/audio-discourse/audeze-crbn-headphones-part-two/"
  sourceTitle="Audeze CRBN Total Harmonic Distortion at approx 80 dB SPL - Positive Feedback"
/>

### **Transient Response**

While lacking quantified specifications, the physical characteristics of electrostatic drivers—extremely lightweight diaphragms—fundamentally promise very fast transient response [14](#ref-14). The speed from sound initiation to rise and fade is extremely fast, enabling faithful reproduction of subtle nuances like percussion attacks and string picking. The CRBN2's uniqueness lies in fusing this electrostatic-specific "speed" with the "impact" that SLAM brings, similar to planar magnetics, becoming the source of the hybrid sound character discussed in many reviews [16](#ref-16).

### **Maximum Sound Pressure Level (Maximum SPL)**

One major attraction of the CRBN is its ability to secure sufficient sound pressure despite being electrostatic. Measurements demonstrate that when paired with the Mjolnir amplifier, it can be driven to 113.4dB SPL at 1kHz while maintaining extremely low 0.025% THD [31](#ref-31). This shows the CRBN series excellently controls dynamic compression and distortion increases that conventional electrostatic headphones tend to suffer at high volumes. With CRBN2, adding SLAM Technology is expected to further secure headroom and improve high-volume stability.

  sourceTitle="Audeze CRBN Maximum SPL at 1kHz with 0.025% THD using Mjolnir Amplifier - Positive Feedback"
/>

### **Absolute Polarity**

Measurements of the original CRBN reported the interesting result of inverted absolute polarity [31](#ref-31). However, this likely doesn't affect electrostatic headphone sound quality. Complete push-pull drivers like the CRBN operate extremely symmetrically for positive and negative signals, so polarity inversion doesn't change distortion characteristics and is unlikely to be perceived as audible differences [31](#ref-31). This can be seen as another proof of how linear and symmetrical the CRBN's driver design is.

## **4. Listening Impressions: Soul-Stirring Sound**

Based on technical analysis, we'll clarify what musical experience the CRBN2 actually provides through impressions quoted from multiple reviews and integrated analysis.

| Reviewer / Media | Quoted Excerpt (Translation + Original) |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Headfonics](https://headfonics.com/audeze-crbn2-review/) | "an even deeper, almost tactile experience, from a driver type that is all too often described as 'polite'." |
| [MajorHiFi](https://majorhifi.com/audeze-crbn2-review/) | "The stereo field takes on the appearance of a bubble wrapping around your headspace... completely open and holographic" |
| [Stereophile (Herb Reichert)](https://www.stereophile.com/content/gramophone-dreams-56-woo-audio-3es-preamplifierheadphone-amplifier-and-audeze-crbn-0) | "neutral, natural, high-detail, low-fatigue, listener-friendly headphone experience." |
| [Reddit User "tehw4nderer"](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1jxx71b/audeze_crbn2s_in_the_house/) | "Still hearing new textures in deep bass (kick drums, bass drums, etc.) that weren't as pronounced before." |
| [Headfonia](https://www.headfonia.com/audeze-crbn2-review/2/) | "The vocal presentation is more to the front and has a clear focus on it. If you like softer, blending in vocals, the CRBN2 probably isn't the headphone for you." |

### **Genre-Specific Impressions**

Synthesizing these reviews, the CRBN2's sound can be said to excellently recreate Audeze's traditional house sound—powerful bass, rich and somewhat forward-positioned midrange, and smooth, non-fatiguing treble—on an electrostatic platform [3](#ref-3).

**Classical Music**
The vast, holographic soundstage pairs extremely well with large orchestral recordings [19](#ref-19). Each instrument's positioning is pinpoint accurate, excelling at recreating the concert hall space itself. Particularly, low string instruments like cellos and double basses benefit from SLAM Technology, reproducing with the resonant richness and weight unavailable from traditional electrostatics [20](#ref-20). Piano sound balances attack sharpness with sustain beauty, fully conveying dynamic range [19](#ref-19). Its high resolution exposes recording quality, but with excellent recordings provides vivid experiences as if performed right before you.

**Jazz**
The reproduction of wood bass's deeply sinking low tones and minute textures when fingers pluck strings is particularly noteworthy [17](#ref-17). Cymbal brilliance is expressed without metallic stimulation through smooth treble tuning, revealing even subtle brush work movements [19](#ref-19). Vocals are positioned somewhat forward with extremely vivid detail like breathing and voice trembling, creating the sensation of listening in intimate spaces [22](#ref-22). Electrostatic speed prevents complex improvisations from becoming muddy, distinguishing each note clearly.

**EDM / Electronica**
This is one of the genres where CRBN2 most displays its personality. Its ability to reproduce deeply sinking synthesizer bass and powerful kick drums—areas where electrostatic headphones have traditionally struggled—with distortion-free "tactile" impact is spectacular [3](#ref-3). Its bass has volume yet is extremely fast and tight, directly conveying the music's energy without sacrificing groove. The vast soundfield expression maximally brings out tracks using spatial effects, enabling highly immersive listening experiences.

**Rock / Pop**
Electric bass lines and powerful drum beats firmly support song foundations, providing satisfaction rivaling planar magnetic headphones [17](#ref-17). Midrange richness gives electric guitar riffs thickness and energy while clearly separating vocals from other instruments. However, some reviews note that depending on recording and amplifier compatibility, upper mids may feel somewhat "shouty," potentially requiring caution with aggressively mixed rock sources [24](#ref-24).

## **5. Comprehensive Evaluation: Questioning Flagship Value**

We'll analyze CRBN2's performance and value from multiple evaluation axes in a multifaceted manner.

| Evaluation Axis | Rating (5-point scale) | Commentary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical Performance** | 5.0 | The combination of second-generation CNT drivers and innovative SLAM Technology represents true progress in electrostatic headphone design. Specifications like THD are world-class, with technical superiority clearly reflected in actual sound quality. |
| **Musical Appeal** | 4.5 | Very attractive and powerful sound that particularly shines with contemporary music genres. Its distinctive character is its greatest strength, but since it differs from traditional electrostatic sound, it won't be accepted by all electrostatic fans. |
| **Build Quality** | 5.0 | Lavishly uses premium materials like magnesium, carbon fiber, and premium leather, hand-assembled in their California factory. The craftsmanship is top-level, worthy of the flagship name [12](#ref-12). |
| **Price-to-Value** | 3.5 | At $5,995 plus requiring high-performance electrostatic-dedicated amplifiers, introduction costs are extremely high. Performance matches the price, but considering total ownership cost, its value can only be enjoyed by select enthusiasts. |
| **Future-proofing / Repairability** | 3.5 | The fixed cable is a major negative factor for long-term maintenance and customization [12](#ref-12). However, Audeze's track record of providing paid upgrade programs from original CRBN to CRBN2 raises expectations for future support [20](#ref-20). |

### **Bias Check: A Balanced View**

Since published reviews tend to emphasize product strengths, here we'll fairly list CRBN2's positive and negative aspects to provide balanced perspective.

**Positive Elements:**

* Unprecedented powerful, textured bass reproduction capability for an electrostatic
* Extremely high detail reproduction ability and fast transients
* Vast, three-dimensional holographic soundstage
* Flawless build quality and design using premium materials
* Excellent fit and comfort for its size and weight
* Resolution of "Stax fart" (diaphragm sticking noise) that plagued the original CRBN [3](#ref-3)

**Negative Elements:**

* Very high main unit price
* Requires separate, expensive electrostatic-dedicated amplifier (energizer)
* Fixed cable makes repair after breaks and sound tuning through re-cabling difficult
* Audeze's distinctive sound character may not suit users seeking traditional electrostatic neutrality or brightness
* Its high resolution ruthlessly exposes poor recording quality

## **6. Broader Perspective: CRBN2's Significance in the Electrostatic Headphone Market**

By positioning CRBN2 not just as an individual product but within the context of the entire high-end electrostatic headphone market, its true significance becomes clear. Currently, three giants with different design philosophies exist at this market's peak.

### **The Three-Way Rule of Modern Electrostatic Headphones**

**Audeze CRBN2 (The Disruptor)**
CRBN2 is the "disruptor" that brought planar magnetic philosophy into the electrostatic headphone world. Its design philosophy prioritizes power, impact, and rich, warm tonal colors above all else. It aims to achieve both electrostatic technical purity and planar magnetic physical thrills, targeting listeners who demand both "speed" and "slam."

**[STAX SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000) (The Purist)**
The [SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000) is the orthodox successor carrying on electrostatic tradition, the "purist." Its design philosophy centers on absolute transparency and fidelity to the source [15](#ref-15). Advanced electrode structures like MLER-3 (multi-layer fixed electrode) and housing designs that thoroughly eliminate resonance exist to realize sound that is airy, ultra-high definition, and often described as bright [27](#ref-27). It's a benchmark for listeners who view headphones as an "open window" to recordings, wanting to eliminate any coloration.

**[Dan Clark Audio CORINA](/en/reviews/danclarkaudio-corina) (The Naturalist)**
CORINA can be positioned as the "naturalist" pursuing musicality and non-fatigue. It adopts innovative AMTS (Acoustic Metamaterial Tuning System) to actively control high-frequency peaks and standing waves that can make some electrostatic headphones sound harsh and unnatural [29](#ref-29). Its goal is sound that is high-resolution yet infinitely smooth, natural, and balanced. It responds to listeners who prioritize comfort in long listening sessions and vibrant tonal colors over analytical listening.

### **Market Segmentation and CRBN2's Strategy**

These three flagship models are not merely competing but actively "segmenting" the summit electrostatic market. Previously, this market was dominated in some sense by a single value system defined by STAX's sound profile. However, Audeze and Dan Clark Audio created new market segments by introducing products that serve different listener preferences formed in the planar magnetic and dynamic worlds, rather than imitating STAX.

CRBN2 clearly targets faithful Audeze fans and the "audiophile basshead" demographic. [CORINA](/en/reviews/danclarkaudio-corina) appeals to listeners sensitive to treble stimulation who seek rich, smooth experiences. And [SR-X9000](/en/reviews/stax-srx9000) continues defending the throne for traditionalists who value absolute transparency above all else. This diversification makes the market healthier and provides users clear choices. No longer does "the single best electrostatic headphone" exist—we've entered an era where "the best headphone for you" exists. CRBN2's emergence is evidence that the high-end market has matured beyond a single acoustic ideal.

## **7. Conclusion & Recommended Users**

The Audeze CRBN2 is a groundbreaking product in electrostatic headphone history. Armed with two innovations—carbon nanotube drivers born from the unusual origins of medical technology and SLAM Technology that overturned bass reproduction conventions—it has successfully fused the power of planar magnetics with electrostatic delicacy, previously considered difficult to achieve. Its sound is deep, fast, and vast. It extracts music's energy and detail completely, enveloping listeners in overwhelming immersion.

However, its personality is not for everyone. This is extremely intentional sound with Audeze's interpretation added to electrostatic tradition. Extracting maximum value requires appropriate investment and understanding.

### **Recommended For:**

* **Planar Magnetic Users:** Those satisfied with current headphones but seeking further speed and resolution while not wanting to lose bass impact.
* **Modern Genre Enthusiasts:** Those who mainly listen to EDM, rock, pop, hip-hop, etc., who felt traditional electrostatics lacked energy or power.
* **Audeze Fans:** Those who love Audeze's distinctive house sound and want to experience its ultimate expression.
* **Soundstage-Priority Listeners:** Those seeking holographic, three-dimensional soundfields and tactile, high-resolution bass.

### **Not Recommended For:**

* **Electrostatic Purists:** Those who prefer traditional, bright, airy, ultimately neutral sound represented by STAX.
* **Budget-Conscious Users:** Total costs become extremely high due to main unit price plus high-performance dedicated amplifier investment requirements.
* **Customization Seekers:** Those who value sound changes through re-cabling or maintenance flexibility due to fixed cables.
* **Uncritical Listeners:** Those who want to enjoy any recording quality, as its outstanding resolution mercilessly exposes recording flaws.

### **Future Updates/Modification Possibilities**

Fixed cables leave almost no room for third-party accessory modifications. However, based on Audeze's track record of providing upgrade programs from original CRBN to CRBN2, manufacturer-led functionality enhancements and improvements might be expected in the future. As a realistic upgrade path, investing in higher-performance energizers would be the most reliable way to further extract CRBN2's potential.

### **Overall Rating: ★★★★☆**

A groundbreaking technical achievement successfully fusing two different headphone philosophies. It establishes new benchmarks for bass performance in electrostatic headphones while providing deep, engaging musical experiences. Considering astronomical pricing, practical constraints of fixed cables, and specialized tuning that doesn't satisfy every corner of the summit market, we've slightly reduced from a perfect score. However, there's no doubt its existence has made the high-end audio world more interesting and diverse.
